An **organism** is a categorical level of organization on the macroscopic level pertaining to biological organisms. One organism is defined as any individual living entity. Typically, an organism has multiple [[011/02/Organs\|organs]] which are specialized to perform different functions that the organism requires to survive. Animals typically also categorize these organs into organ systems, while prokaryotic organisms like bacteria and archaea have no organ systems, let alone organs.

Regardless of these differences between domains and [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clades]], a group of the same organism in an approximate location is known as a [[move later/Biological Population\|population]].
