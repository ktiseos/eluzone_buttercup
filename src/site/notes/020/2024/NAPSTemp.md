hi there! i’m ellie, and i’ll be the prog lead for the **2-HOUR M[]S RUN** starting <t:**[TIMESTAMP]**:F> <t:**[TIMESTAMP]**:R>! we will be on **[DATA CENTER]**, and the PF will be up by <t:**[-30]**:t> in the private tab.

- **OUR STRATS ARE: [variable per fight: CHOOSE ONE]**
  - **[M1S:]** TN | Same Bait | DPS 1st | Supp CCW | THD | **Starrvy MTTT**

- \# if you choose to watch a guide…
  - **[M1S:]** every strat site/guide is different i’m sorry 💀 but this is __identical__ to the https://discord.com/channels/1272610310095900753/1279935645921316895 thread in-server. if you are watching [Hector’s guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UB5x8JzAiQ), use his addendums for [same baits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOCqbHRQw2Q) and [Starrvy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiF_c4dwXU8) instead of clock baits and MTTT. if you are referencing [joonbob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vb3TCqz4F8&t=370s) or [thepfstrat](<https://www.thepfstrat.com/M1S>), use the Starrvy strat instead of MTTT.

@m[]s prog Hi! I’m looking for **ONE [DPS] WHO HAS NOT CLEARED/IS CURRENTLY PROGGING M[]S** for a NAPS run starting <t:**[TIMESTAMP]**:F> <t:**[TIMESTAMP]**:R>. **[ANY DPS ROLES/JOBS ENCOURAGED.]** This is a 2-hour session with i710+ gear and raid food requirement, and you do not need to watch a guide before joining (encouraged, but not required!!!!!!!); you just need to **ping me in this thread** and let me know **before** <t:**[TIMESTAMP]**:F>, one hour before the start time.

**IF YOU HAVE CLEARED M[]S:** do not apply! Sorry, but I already have a fill in case no one reaches out. This ad is *ONLY* for people who are progging M[]S.

Thank you so much!
