(by the way, we have an open spot! please reference [SORRY, I‚ÄôM ABOUT TO POST IT, GIVE ME A MINUTE] in #looking-for-party if you are interested in joining this run. thank you so much!!)

@m[]s prog Hi! I‚Äôm looking for **ONE [DPS] WHO HAS NOT CLEARED/IS CURRENTLY PROGGING M[]S** for a NAPS run starting <t:**[TIMESTAMP]**:F> <t:**[TIMESTAMP]**:R>. **[ANY DPS ROLES/JOBS ENCOURAGED.]** This is a 2-hour session with i710+ gear and raid food requirement, and you do not need to watch a guide before joining (encouraged, but not required!!!!!!!); you just need to **ping me in this thread** and let me know **before** <t:**[TIMESTAMP]**:F>, one hour before the start time.

**IF YOU HAVE CLEARED M[]S:** do not apply! Sorry, but I already have a fill in case no one reaches out. This ad is *ONLY* for people who are progging M[]S.

Thank you so much!

- **OTHER:**
  - **YOU MUST BRING i710+ gear and raid food, or you‚Äôll die from raidwides and mechanics.**
  - **PROGGING THE FIGHT?** let me know your prog point! (ZERO judgment; i just want to prepare to help better!)
  - **[M1S/M3S ONLY:]** :healer: WE ARE RUNNING **DOUBLE REGEN**. i‚Äôve done it; it‚Äôs fun!! i just ask we really use those party mits after final fusedown or we‚Äôll fall to the floor.
  - :peanutgallery: i will be streaming on [TWITCH](<https://twitch.tv/ktiseos>) with all names initialized, comms muted, and full privacy outside the server. HOWEVER, if anyone is uncomfortable with it being on twitch, let me know, and i will not stream there! (if i do, i'd appreciate if someone else could stream for the VC.)
