Atop a silver platter from your cherry counter

<span style="display: inline-block; width: 5ch;">&#9;</span> are three strawberry-heart rice cakes.

I used the finest ingredients in the world—

<span style="display: inline-block; width: 5ch;">&#9;</span> with strawberries and red beans that could

<span style="display: inline-block; width: 5ch;">&#9;</span> procure a rare twinkle from your coral eyes—

<span style="display: inline-block; width: 5ch;">&#9;</span> and plucked, and whisked, and steamed, and rolled

<span style="display: inline-block; width: 5ch;">&#9;</span> until I formed the best strawberry-heart rice cakes I could.

( But they look like lumps: sallow, unshapely, with cuts on the sides. )

As I hold out the platter, I wonder:

<span style="display: inline-block; width: 5ch;">&#9;</span> “Do you really deserve to see these inedible, unpalatable sweets?

<span style="display: inline-block; width: 5ch;">&#9;</span> I mean, I know that mirrors don’t call you Helen or Aphrodite—but I do.

<span style="display: inline-block; width: 5ch;">&#9;</span> But you’ve always adored these strawberry-heart cakes,

<span style="display: inline-block; width: 5ch;">&#9;</span> and been as enamored with them as I have been.

<span style="display: inline-block; width: 5ch;">&#9;</span> So, even if these aren’t deep sea pearls, or the scales of a mermaid’s tail,

<span style="display: inline-block; width: 5ch;">&#9;</span> would you still love them as much as I love you?”
