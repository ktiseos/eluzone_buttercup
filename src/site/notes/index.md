This is a very funny quote to appropriate from the 2007 video game, *The World Ends With You*, because it was not referring to the crux of this site at all.

Hi! I’m Ellie, or JL, whichever you may know me by. I am a ✨ **Marine Biology and Coastal Sciences, Organismal Biology subdivision major** ✨, a [Final Fantasy XIV completionist](https://ffxivcollect.com/characters/36357440), and an occasional [AO3 writer](https://archiveofourown.org/users/inkroller) and multifandom roleplayer. I am also a taken any/all lesbian so do not even try lol.

This is my personal [[011/001/Digital Gardening\|garden]], or site, if you prefer. I use this garden to preserve my writing: my [[011/index\|academic notes]], written in the form of a [[011/001/Zettelkasten\|Zettelkasten]]-[[Wikis\|Wikis]]; my [[021/unraveled\|personal work]]; and excerpts of past reflections. Most of my work is drafted and stored locally via the markdown editor [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which lacks native, free-to-use [sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) and [note sharing](https://obsidian.md/publish). I am a cheapskate, and, again, a college student and a Final Fantasy XIV raider, so I have refused to pay money and instead have learned to host and partially code a site myself in order to share my college notes with those who may need them. And, so, we are here.

I encourage the reuse of and sharing of the work I have displayed here provided it is credited. Please always note, especially for academic notes, that the work done is based on lectures and information that was present when the note was written; one should always remain scientifically [[Skepticism\|skeptic]] and take no information as dogma. And, please do not steal my creative works!
