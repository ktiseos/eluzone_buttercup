The **biosphere** is a categorical level of organization on the macroscopic level adjacent to [[011/0209/Biology\|biological]] [[011/0209/Organism\|organisms]] and the most macroscopic structural level of life. The biosphere includes every place on a single planet in which living things exist, and is specific to places and environments. As a result, this is one of the only structural levels which is made solely of non-living components.
