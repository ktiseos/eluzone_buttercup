**Tracheids** are a kind of [[011/0209/Water-Conducting Cells\|water-conducting cell]] which can be found in any kind of [[Land Plants\|land plant]]. They are the only type of water-conducting cell present in most [[011/0209/Bryophytes\|bryophytes]] and [[011/0209/Gymnosperms\|gymnosperms]].

Tracheids appear as long, thin cells which taper off at both ends. The [[011/0209/Secondary Cell Wall\|secondary cell walls]] are perforated by [[011/0209/Plant Cell Pit\|pits]]; water travels through tracheids by traveling through pits which are lined up to intersect between cells. These pits have a [[Pit Membranes\|pit membrane]] between them which prevent [[011/0209/Gas Embolisms\|embolisms]] from traveling and rupturing the cell.

Tracheids are less efficient than [[011/0209/Vessel Elements\|vessel elements]]. However, they are the only water-conducting cells with pit membranes, meaning they are less susceptible to destruction via embolisms.
