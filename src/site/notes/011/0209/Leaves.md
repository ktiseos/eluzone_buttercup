**Leaves** are [[011/0209/Organs\|organs]] found in the [[011/0209/Shoot System\|shoot system]] of all [[011/0209/Vascular Plants\|vascular plants]]. Although their form and the existence of [[Secondary Functions\|secondary functions]] vary, they are primarily developed so that the plant can perform optimal [[Photosynthesis\|photosynthesis]]. Leaves are made from a [[011/0209/Leaf Blade\|blade]] that maximizes the [[Surface Area\|surface area]] of sunlight absorbed and [[Veins\|veins]] which transport nutrients and water through [[Vascular Tissue\|vascular tissue]].

A typical leaf consists of the leaf blade and the [[011/0209/Petiole\|petiole]]. It attaches to the [[011/0209/Stems\|stem]] at a [[011/0209/Plant Nodes\|node]]. This attachment forms an [[011/0209/Axils\|axil]] and creates the opportunity for [[011/0209/Axillary Buds\|axillary buds]] to grow. Leaves grow in standardized patterns when no [[Mutation\|mutation]] occurs. They may be present in [[011/0209/Simple Leaf\|simple]], [[011/0209/Compound Leaves\|compound]], or [[011/0209/Intermediately Compound Leaves\|intermediate]] patterns; they may be [[011/0209/Pinnate Leaves\|pinnately]] or [[011/0209/Palmate Leaves\|palmately]] attached to a single node; and they may be [[011/0209/Alternate Leaves\|alternating]], [[011/0209/Opposite Leaves\|opposite]], or [[011/0209/Whorled Leaves\|whorled leaves]].

Leaves are a modifiable organ. For example, when present in the reproductive region of an [[011/0209/Angiosperms\|angiosperm]], they make up the [[011/0209/Petals\|petals]] and [[011/0209/Sepals\|sepals]] of the [[011/0209/Flowers\|flower]], and their structure is modified into a [[011/0209/Pistils\|pistil]] [[011/0209/Carpels\|carpel]]. They may be modified for additional functions in [[011/0209/Herbs\|herbaceous]] [[011/0209/Bulbs\|bulbs]] and as the [[Bracts\|bracts]] of angiosperms and [[011/0209/Gymnosperms\|gymnosperms]]. Other examples include some plant tendrils and the defensive spines of cacti.

Most leaves grow [[011/0209/Indeterminate Growth\|indeterminately]] alongside the plant unless they are modified for a specific purpose. In sympodial plants, the flower grows on the terminal of the shoot using the [[Leaf Primordia\|leaf primordia]], which prevents the growth of further leaves on that stem.
