An **axil** is the angle of the distance in a [[011/0209/Vascular Plants\|vascular plant]] between the upper side of a [[011/0209/Leaves\|leaf]] and the [[011/0209/Stems\|stem]] that it is attached to. Axils contain [[011/0209/Axillary Buds\|axillary buds]] which allow for [[Primary Tissues\|primary tissue]] growth; this extends the plant vertically and forms branches of stem where additional [[Module\|modules]] can grow.
