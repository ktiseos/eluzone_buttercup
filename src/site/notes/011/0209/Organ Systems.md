An **organ system** is a grouping of similar [[011/0209/Organs\|organs]]. It is the penultimate categorical level which denotes the structure of [[011/0209/Cells\|cells]] in a [[011/0209/Biology\|biological]] [[011/0209/Organism\|organism]], and when present, it precedes the organismal level itself.

Not all organisms possess organ systems, such as Spongifera, fungi, and prokaryotes; however, any entity that possesses organ systems can be defined as an organism.
