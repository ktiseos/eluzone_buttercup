**Bryophytes** are an informal, non-[[011/0209/Taxonomy\|taxonomical]] classification of [[Land Plants\|land plants]]. They are one of the broadest classifications for land plants alongside [[011/0209/Vascular Plants\|vascular plants]]. Bryophytes are also known as non-vascular plants, and they are differentiated from vascular plants via the absence of [[Vascular Tissue\|vascular tissue]].

Bryophytes are small, thin plants. The absence of vascular [[011/0209/Tissues\|tissue]] curtails bryophytesâ€™ ability to circulate water, minerals, and sugars, preventing the majority of bryophytes from growing substantially large. All bryophytes are [[011/0209/Herbs\|herbs]]; the category includes the phyla *Bryophyta*, *Hepatophyta*, and *Anthocerophyta*, commonly known as the mosses, liverworts, and hornworts.
