The **middle lamella** is the outermost [[Cell Walls\|cell wall]] layer of plant cells. It is the first and [[011/0209/Primary Cell Wall\|primary cell wall]] developed in plant cells; all plant cells possess it through their death.

The middle lamella is made from a layer of [[011/0209/Pectin\|pectins]]. The presence of pectin makes the middle lamella [[Hydrophilia\|hydrophilic]], allowing water to permeate between [[011/0209/Cells\|cells]]. Due to its presence, the middle lamella is also used to connect cells together.
