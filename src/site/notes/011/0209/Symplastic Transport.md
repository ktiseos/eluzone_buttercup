**Symplastic transport** is the transport of materials through a [[011/0209/Plasmodesmata\|plasmodesma]] from one cell to another. The materials remain in the [[Cytoplasm\|cytoplasm]] even as they transfer across the plasmodesmata. Symplastic transport is not usually facilitated through the [[011/0209/Desmotubule\|desmotubules]], but the cytoplasm itself.
