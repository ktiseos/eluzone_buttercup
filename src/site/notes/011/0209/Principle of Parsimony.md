The **principle of parsimony** is the prioritization of the simplest possible explanation for provided evidence. This principle is synonymous with **Occam’s razor** (also spelled as **Ockham’s razor**), a philosophical rule.

The principle of parsimony is emphasized in [[011/0209/Phylogenetics\|Phylogenetics]]. In phylogenetics, a parsimonious explanation of [[011/0209/Evolution\|evolution]] assumes as few evolutionary changes occurred between [[011/0209/Taxa\|taxa]]. This includes the rise of a new [[011/0209/Evolutionary Traits\|trait]] via evolution or a [[011/0209/'Reversal of State' Evolution\|'Reversal of State' Evolution]]. Biologists assume that the parsimonious explanation is the most likely to be accurate in the evolution of taxa.
