The **radicle** is an [[Embryo\|embryonic]] [[011/0209/Organs\|organ]] in [[011/0209/Vascular Plants\|vascular plants]] that develops into its [[011/0209/Root System\|root system]]. The radicle drastically changes during development, and its appearance in maturation differs depending on the embryoâ€™s [[011/0209/Taxonomic Clades\|clade]]. In all [[011/0209/Angiosperms\|angiosperms]], the radicle develops into a [[Primary Root\|primary root]]. However, in typical [[011/0209/Monocots\|monocots]], this radicle remains the primary root, and [[Lateral Roots\|lateral roots]] develop off of it, before later dying off; in typical [[011/0209/Eudicots\|eudicots]], the radicle thickens into a [[Taproot\|taproot]] and forms the center of the [[011/0209/Taproot System\|taproot system]]. This may differ in plants where the [[Roots\|root]] organs must be modified, such as where the taproot thickens into a storage root.

In maturing eudicots, a hook forms within the growing taproot. The location of this hook may vary, but it will always remain within the developed radicle. This hook does not tend to form in monocots.
