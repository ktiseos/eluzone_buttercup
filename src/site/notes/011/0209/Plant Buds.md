**Plant buds** are developing sections of the [[011/0209/Stems\|stem]] in the [[011/0209/Shoot System\|shoot system]] of [[011/0209/Vascular Plants\|vascular plants]]. There are two kinds of plant buds, named accordingly by the area in which the bud develops: [[011/0209/Apical Buds\|apical buds]] (or terminal buds) and [[011/0209/Axillary Buds\|axillary buds]]. Plant buds enclose and protect [[011/0209/Apical Meristems\|apical meristems]] and allow the plant to expand via [[Primary Tissues\|primary tissue]] growth.
