**Xylem** is a [[Complex Tissues\|complex tissue]] found in the [[Vascular Tissue System\|vascular tissue system]] of [[Land Plants\|land plants]]. It is used to transport water and minerals through plant cells. Xylem is made of three types of cells: [[011/0209/Water-Conducting Cells\|water-conducting cells]], [[011/0209/Parenchyma\|parenchyma]] cells, and [[Sclerenchyma\|sclerenchyma]] [[Sclerenchyma Fibers\|fibers]]. The water-conducting cells are exclusively found in xylem [[011/0209/Tissues\|tissue]].

Xylem begins as [[Primary Xylem\|primary xylem]] while its region of the [[011/0209/Shoot System\|shoot]] is still developing. As the shoot begins to mature, the [[Protoxylem\|protoxylem]] matures into [[Metaxylem\|metaxylem]]. Ultimately, the protoxylem will die off, maturing into either kind of water-conducting cell or the sclerenchyma fiber.
