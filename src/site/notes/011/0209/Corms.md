A **corm** is a [[011/0209/Stems\|stem]] in an [[011/0209/Herbs\|herbaceous]] [[011/0209/Vascular Plants\|vascular plant]] that has been modified to store food. In plants that possess a corm, the stem is modified into a large, fleshy, and bulbous sheath that wraps around the food.

Like [[011/0209/Bulbs\|bulbs]], corms occur in underground [[Biennials\|biennials]], and they are used to protect food over time as they develop and hibernate; however, corms are distinguished via the presence of circular, horizontal [[011/0209/Plant Nodes\|nodes]]. These nodes are typical of [[011/0209/Monocots\|monocots]]: accordingly, only monocots are known to modify their stems into corms. Examples of these monocots include bananas, gladiolus, and taro [[Roots\|roots]].
