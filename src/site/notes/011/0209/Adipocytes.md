An **adipocyte** is a [[011/0209/Specialization\|specialized]] [[011/0209/Cells\|cell]] found in [[011/0209/Adipose Tissues\|adipose tissue]]. Adipocytes have a high volume to accommodate for their [[011/0209/Fat Vacuoles\|fat vacuoles]]. These [[Vacuoles\|vacuoles]] store the [[Triglycerides\|triglyceride]] that makes up [[Fat\|body fat]], but push the other [[Organelles\|organelles]], the [[Nucleus\|nucleus]], and the [[Cytoplasm\|cytoplasm]] to the edges of the adipocyte. These cells appear mostly colorless due to the stored triglyceride.
