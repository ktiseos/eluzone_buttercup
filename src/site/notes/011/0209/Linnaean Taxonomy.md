The **Linnaean taxonomical system** is a [[011/0209/Systematics\|systematic]] classification of [[011/0209/Organism\|organisms]] into nested, [[Hierarchies\|hierarchal]] ranks that was invented by [[Carolus Linnaeus\|Carolus Linnaeus]]. This system has pervaded into modern day and expanded since Linnaeus’s time.

The modern zoological ranks of Linnaean taxonomy, from broadest to most specific, are as follows, with the major ranks being numbered and minor ranks being bulleted:
1. [[Domains\|Domains]];
2. [[Kingdoms\|Kingdoms]];
3. [[Phyla\|Phyla]];
4. [[Classes\|Classes]];
5. [[Orders\|Orders]];
6. [[Families\|Families]];
	- Superfamilies;
	- Subfamilies;
	- Tribes;
	- Subtribes;
7. [[Genera\|Genera]];
	- Subgenera;
8. [[Species\|Species]].
	- Subspecies.

In the Linnaean taxonomical system, ranks between domains and families are always capitalized, but not italicized. Ranks involving genera and species are italicized or underlined; see the connected system of [[011/0209/Binomial Nomenclature\|binomial nomenclature]] for more information.
