A **tissue** is a categorical level of organization on the cellular level within [[011/0209/Biology\|biological]] [[011/0209/Organism\|organisms]]. A tissue is a grouping of [[011/0209/Cells\|cells]] who chiefly possess similar embryonic developmental origins as well as similar functions. A grouping of these tissues is then known as an [[011/0209/Organs\|organ]].

There are over 200 distinct animal tissues with separate origin and function, such as [[011/0209/Adipose Tissues\|adipose tissues]], [[011/0209/Cartilage\|cartilage]], and spinal tissues. However, they can be generally categorized into four types: [[011/0209/Epithelial Tissues\|epithelial]], [[011/0209/Connective Tissues\|connective]], [[Muscle\|muscle]], and [[Nervous\|nervous]] tissues.

Due to its composition of cells, all tissues are made from fully living components.

Biological tissues are studied via a branch of microbiology known as [[011/0209/Histology\|histology]].
