**Plasmodesmata** are intercellular connections that facilitate [[011/0209/Cells\|cellular]] communication. Plasmodesmata occupy the [[Cytoplasm\|cytoplasm]] in the openings of the cell wall, including the [[011/0209/Desmotubule\|desmotubules]] between the continuous cell membrane of plant cells.

Plasmodesmata are used to circulate materials across plant cells via [[011/0209/Symplastic Transport\|symplastic transport]]. They are all incredibly tiny, being no more than 0.3 to 0.6 microns wide each; as a result, hundreds may be present and clustered together in a [[011/0209/Primary Pit Field\|primary pit field]].
