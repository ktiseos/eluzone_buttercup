The **coleoptile** is a thick [[011/0209/Tissues\|tissue]] that covers the [[011/0209/Plumule\|plumule]] and eventually the growing [[011/0209/Shoot System\|shoot]] of a [[011/0209/Vascular Plants\|vascular plant]]. It is specifically present in [[011/0209/Monocots\|monocots]] that do not form hooks in the developing [[Hypocotyl\|hypocotyl]] or [[011/0209/Radicle\|radicle]] regions after emerging; it exists to protect and sheath the plumule and later the emerged [[011/0209/Apical Meristems\|apical meristem]] as it erupts vertically from the ground.

The coleoptile grows between the plumule and the [[011/0209/Cotyledons\|cotyledon]]; this forms an [[011/0209/Internodes\|internode]] between the connection of the cotyledon and the connection of the coleoptile known as the [[Mesocotyl\|mesocotyl]].

During juvenile growth, the coleoptile forms a “bump” on the aboveground plant. Closer to the [[011/0209/Leaf Blade\|leaf blades]] that develop from the apical [[011/0209/Meristems\|meristem]], the coleoptile appears thinner and translucent, and one can see the linear, parallel lines, similar to that in a standard monocot [[011/0209/Leaves\|leaf]].
