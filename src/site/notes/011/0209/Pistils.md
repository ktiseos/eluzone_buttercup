A **pistil** is a large structure in the center of the [[011/0209/Flowers\|flower]] of an [[011/0209/Angiosperms\|angiosperm]] that stores its eggs. The pistil contains at least one [[Ovules\|ovule]]; these ovules store the eggs, and they are protected and maintained by the pistil.

A pistil is made up of one or more [[011/0209/Carpels\|carpels]] which have been fused together. The term pistil refers to a “female” structure, and the ovaries and ovules are considered as the “female” flower part or sexual [[011/0209/Organs\|organ]] in a plant.

A group of pistils, or all of the pistils of a flower, is also known as a [[gynoecium\|gynoecium]].
