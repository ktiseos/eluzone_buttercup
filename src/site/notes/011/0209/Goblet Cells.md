A **goblet cell** is a [[011/0209/Specialization\|specialized]] [[011/0209/Simple Epithelial Tissues\|simple]] [[011/0209/Columnar\|columnar]] [[011/0209/Epithelial Tissues\|epithelial cell]] that contains gelatinous [[Mucous\|mucous]]. The cell is accordingly named for its vase-like or goblet-like shape; the spherical section of the cell encases the light-staining mucous.

Goblet cells [[Function\|function]] to secrete gelatinous mucous which is used in lubrication and protection. As they are epithelial cells, they are found in the epithelial lining of [[011/0209/Organs\|organs]] such as the [[Trachea\|trachea]], the [[Small Intestine\|small intestine]], and the [[Large Intestine\|large intestine]], and they are found alongside other simple columnar epithelial cells over the [[Basement Membrane\|basement membrane]].
