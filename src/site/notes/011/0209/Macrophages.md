They are named for their function (as *phagocytes*) and their relative but distinct size (*macro-*) in comparison to cells such as those found in [[011/0209/Connective Tissues\|connective tissues]] such as [[011/0209/Loose Connective Tissues\|loose connective tissue]], especially when viewed under a microscope.
