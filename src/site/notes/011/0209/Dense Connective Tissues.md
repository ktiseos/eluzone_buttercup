**Dense connective tissues** are a type of [[011/0209/Connective Tissues\|connective tissue]]. Unlike the similarly named [[011/0209/Loose Connective Tissues\|loose connective tissues]], dense connective tissues get their namesake from the lack of gelatinous [[011/0209/Ground Substance\|ground substance]] present in the [[011/0209/Tissues\|tissue]]. The [[011/0209/Matrix\|matrix]] is made of proportionally more [[011/0209/Proteinaceous Fibers\|proteinaceous fibers]], specifically [[Collagen\|collagenous]] fibers which are tightly packed in a parallel pattern. These make the tissue sturdier, but inelastic.

Dense connective tissues also have [[Fibroblasts\|fibroblast]] [[011/0209/Cells\|cells]], but they are pushed to the side between the collagenous fibers and compressed. Under a microscope, this may result in the fibroblasts appearing flat. This can distinguish them and their respective tissues from [[Smooth Muscle Tissues\|smooth]] [[Muscle Tissues\|muscle tissues]].

Dense connective tissues are found in [[011/0209/Organs\|organs]] such as the [[Tendons\|tendon]] and the [[Ligaments\|ligament]] keeping muscles and [[Bone\|bones]] attached. Due to their density, while strong connectors, their inelasticity makes their organs easy to tear if pushed and twisted in a way they should not be.
