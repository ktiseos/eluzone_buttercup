A **node** is typically the location on a [[Plants\|plant]] in the [[011/0209/Shoot System\|shoot system]] where a [[011/0209/Leaves\|leaf]] is attached to the [[011/0209/Stems\|stem]]. The leaf may be attached via the [[011/0209/Petiole\|petiole]] structure or it may be directly connected to the stem.

Nodes may also have [[011/0209/Axillary Buds\|axillary buds]] attached in the [[011/0209/Axils\|axil]] formed between the leaf at the node and the stem.

Alternatively, nodes are present on the [[Roots\|roots]] of the [[011/0209/Root System\|root system]], and [[011/0209/Adventitious Roots\|adventitious roots]] grow from them.

Nodes are separated from one another via [[011/0209/Internodes\|internode]] regions.
