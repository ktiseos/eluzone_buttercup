**Bud scales** are modified [[011/0209/Leaves\|leaves]] that protect the [[011/0209/Plant Buds\|plant buds]] in [[011/0209/Vascular Plants\|vascular plants]]. The bud scales enclose a [[011/0209/Meristems\|meristem]], and in the case of the [[011/0209/Apical Meristems\|apical meristem]], the [[Leaf Primordia\|leaf primordia]], until the unmodified leaves have developed and no longer need to be protected by the scales.
