The **secondary cell wall** is a [[Cell Walls\|cell wall]] layer found in some plant [[011/0209/Cells\|cells]], most often dead cells and [[Secondary Tissues\|secondary tissue]]. It is a thick, rigid, [[Hydrophobia\|hydrophobic]] cell layer which prevents the transport of most materials into the cell.

The secondary cell wall is made with a cross-netting of [[Cellulose\|cellulose]] microfibrils and a dense, multimaterial [[011/0209/Matrix\|matrix]]. The matrix is primarily made from [[011/0209/Lignin\|lignin]] and [[Hemicellulose\|hemicellulose]], the former of which causing the cell wall to harden and waterproof.

The secondary cell wall is so rigid that it prevents further growth of the cell. When it is deposited, the cell is expected to die, although there is a chance that it may not.
