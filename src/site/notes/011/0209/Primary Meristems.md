**Primary meristems** are layers of [[011/0209/Meristems\|meristematic]] [[011/0209/Tissues\|tissue]] produced by the [[011/0209/Apical Meristems\|apical meristem]] of a [[011/0209/Vascular Plants\|vascular plant]]. Three kinds of primary meristem exist:

- **[[Protoderm\|Protoderm]]**, which matures into the [[Dermal Tissue System\|dermal tissue system]];
- **[[Procambium\|Procambium]]**, which matures into the [[Vascular Tissue System\|vascular tissue system]];
- and **[[Ground Meristem\|Ground meristem]]**, which matures into the [[Ground Tissue System\|ground tissue system]].

The primary meristems can be found surrounding the apical meristem in the [[011/0209/Stems\|stem]] tip. Additionally, though most of this meristematic tissue permanently differentiates into new [[011/0209/Cells\|cell]] types, some exceptions exist. **[[Residual Procambium\|Residual procambium]]** remains around many of the [[Vascular Bundles\|vascular bundles]] in the [[Pith Ray\|pith ray]] of the stem. In other older bundles, the residual procambium and [[011/0209/Parenchyma\|parenchyma cells]] have differentiated into [[Vascular Cambium\|vascular cambium]].
