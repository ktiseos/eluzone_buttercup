A **squamous** [[011/0209/Cells\|cell]] is a thin and flat [[011/0209/Epithelial Tissues\|epithelial]] cell often found near or on the free surface of the epithelial [[011/0209/Tissues\|tissue]] layer. Its name derives from *squame* or *squama*, which describes a covering with a plate, flake, or especially *scale-like* quality, or a covering that is like the scales of a [[Fishes\|fish]] or a [[Reptiles\|reptile]].

In a [[011/0209/Stratified Epithelial Tissues\|stratified epithelial tissue]], squamous cells are prominently found as the oldest cells and are found on the free surface of the tissue. They are former [[011/0209/Columnar\|columnar]] cells that were compressed over time into [[011/0209/Cuboidal\|cuboidal]], then squamous cells.
