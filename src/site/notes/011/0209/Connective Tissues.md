The **connective tissue** category is a diverse grouping of [[011/0209/Tissues\|tissues]] that are used to join together and/or protect and support [[011/0209/Organs\|organs]] and other tissues.

Connective tissues are recognized and named by their density and the [[011/0209/Proteinaceous Fibers\|proteinaceous fibers]] within their [[011/0209/Matrix\|matrix]], a signature of connective tissues. They also possess [[011/0209/Specialization\|specialized]] [[011/0209/Cells\|cells]] tailored to each connective tissue, such as [[011/0209/Adipocytes\|adipocytes]] and [[Erythrocytes\|erythrocytes]].

This is a broad category which can include connective tissues found in the [[Trachea\|trachea]] or [[Bone\|bone]], but also includes [[011/0209/Bone Tissue\|bone]] itself and blood cells. The ones studied by the archivist so far include:
