A **simple epithelial tissue** is an [[011/0209/Epithelial Tissues\|epithelial tissue]] which possesses a single layer of [[011/0209/Tissues\|tissue]] [[011/0209/Cells\|cells]].

Simple epithelial tissues are do not densely buffet extracellular materials and are most commonly found in areas that materials frequently need to permeate. This means places where [[Absorption\|absorption]] or [[Secretion\|secretion]] rates are high tend to have simple epithelial tissues, such as the [[Lungs\|lungs]] or the [[Intestines\|intestine]].

A [[Pseudostratified Epithelial Tissues\|pseudostratified epithelial tissue]] is still categorized as a simple epithelial tissue.
