**Allopatric Speciation** is a phenomenon in which a [[011/0209/Biological Population\|population]] is subdivided through any manner of complete geographical isolation and undergoes speciation. Allopatry involves the total separation of members of the population, with no overlap. It also involves considerable distance between the subdivisions. These conditions are fulfilled via one of two scenarios: via the process of vicariance or via a founder event.
