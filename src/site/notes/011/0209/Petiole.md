The **petiole** is a stalk-like structure found in the standard two-part structure of [[011/0209/Leaves\|leaves]]. Despite looking like the [[011/0209/Stems\|stem]], it is not actually a part of the stem of the plant. Additionally, the term encompasses the stalk of both [[011/0209/Simple Leaf\|simple leaves]] and the stalk that joins [[Leaflets\|leaflets]] to the petiole attached at the [[011/0209/Plant Nodes\|node]] of a [[011/0209/Compound Leaves\|compound leaf]]. The petiole is not necessary to identify a leaf, but the presence of it immediately denotes the presence of a leaf.

Typically, the petiole attaches the remainder of the [[011/0209/Leaf Blade\|blade]] to a node on the stem. It has a variety of functions for the leaf. It acts as a channel connecting [[Vascular Tissue\|vascular tissue]] to the leaf, allowing for the transport of minerals and nutrients between the photosynthesizing leaf and the storage [[011/0209/Cells\|cells]] of the stem. Additionally, it is used in phototropism to optimize the ability of the leaf to photosynthesize by twisting it in the direction of sunlight.
