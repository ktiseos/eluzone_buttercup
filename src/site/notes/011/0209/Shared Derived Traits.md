A **shared derived trait** is a [[011/0209/Evolutionary Traits\|trait]] that evolved in descendant [[011/0209/Sister Groups\|sister]] [[011/0209/Taxa\|taxa]] within a [[011/0209/Taxonomic Clades\|clade]]. A change occurred that caused the [[011/0209/Evolution\|evolution]] of a different trait within the derivative [[011/0209/Organism\|organisms]]. This may be referred to as an “evolutionary novelty.”
