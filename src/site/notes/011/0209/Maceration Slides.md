A **maceration slide** is a slide in which the [[011/0209/Middle Lamella\|middle lamellae]] of the studied [[011/0209/Cells\|cells]] have been dissolved, leaving the [[011/0209/Protoplast\|protoplast]] and the inner [[Cell Walls\|cell walls]] spread out on the slide. As a result, [[Organelles\|organelles]] and [[011/0209/Tissues\|tissue]] within the cells, such as, when in a section of [[Primary Tissues\|primary tissue]], [[Protoxylem\|protoxylem]], [[Metaxylem\|metaxylem]], [[011/0209/Tracheids\|tracheids]], [[011/0209/Vessel Elements\|vessel elements]], [[Phloem\|phloem]] fibers, and [[011/0209/Parenchyma\|parenchyma]] cells, can be seen clearer across the slide.
