**Phenotypic plasticity** is a form of [[Plasticity\|plasticity]] which encompasses the ability of identical plant [[011/0209/Cells\|cells]] to develop into different [[Phenotypes\|phenotypes]] depending on the environment in which the plant cell is present. Although the genes of the plant cells are identical, their form ultimately depends on the conditions of their environment, such as the temperature or the amount of sunlight received, or the function of the cell in the plant.

Phenotypic plasticity can be especially observed in aquatic plants such as *Cabomba aquatica*, where different regions of the plant are submerged or disproportionately affected by sunlight, or underground plants such as onions, who must adapt to lower amounts of sunlight and utilize their organs for additional functions.

Phenotypic plasticity is also known as developmental plasticity. It can modify [[011/0209/Leaves\|leaves]] and other [[011/0209/Organs\|organs]] which the cells develop into.
