**Bulliform cells** are large, bubble-shaped [[Dermal Tissue System\|dermal tissue]] cells often found on the upper epidermis of [[011/0209/Monocots\|monocot]] [[011/0209/Leaves\|leaves]]. They are used to fold and unfold leaves. This occurs in response to the value of turgor pressure within the cell: when the bulliform cells lose turgor pressure, they become flaccid and shrivel, causing the leaves to fold inwards. This mechanism is used in monocots to prevent water loss through evaporation in [[Xeric Conditions\|xerophytic]] conditions, as the bulliform cells share the same tissue layer as that of many [[Stomata\|stomata]].
