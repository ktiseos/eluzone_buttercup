- first inhabitants: Coast Miwok and Pomo peoples
	- tideland collectors, acorn gatherers, game hunters
	- 8000y
	- tracked time via seasonal abundance of food and moon phases
- Hoo-koo-e-ko and Tamalko; He’-koo-las developed first light, Sunwoman
# weather and climate
- winter rain and summer drought; central coast
	- constant temperature: average 10-13\*C between midwinter and midsummer
	- “one of the most equitable climates on the continent”
	- high moisture; few extreme weathers
		- occasional frost and ice
		- almost no snow
	- high presence of wind and fog
## Ocean Currents
- **North Pacific High**
	- mass of cool air 1k off CA coast
	- migrates longitudinally seasonally
	- large pressure system
	- from Northern Hemispheric winter (sun @ 23.5\*S, Tropic of Capricorn) → High migrates from coast of Mexico (23.5\*N, Tropic of Cancer) → northward to 38\*N (Point Reyes); returns to coast of Mexico next winter
		- pulse-like; stabilizes climate and deflects storms in summer, then leaves susceptible in winter
		- “huge fan”; high → low pressure air movement moves CW in Northern Hemisphere/Pacific Ocean surface waters
- **North Pacific Gyre**
	- multiple oceanic currents CW on margin in response to NPH
	- **California Current:** wide, east current into shore; slow air current
		- surface waters are important in Point Reyes climate; average 12\*C with extremes of 8.8–16
	- North Pacific Drift
		- **Kuroshio Current:** North into Japan, then NE into NP
		- **Oyashio Current:** northern, cold subarctic wind
### California Current periods: Upwelling, Oceanic, and Davidson Countercurrent
- **Upwelling Period:**
	- spring and summer average; extremes in February to September
		- peaks in June/July
	- longest period and largest influence
	- upwelling of nutrient rich water into nearshore
	- spring winds move waters offshore and induce cold waters from sub-182m to fill niche
	- June/July waters can be 8.8–13\*C; coldest on west coast
		- creates peninsula fog
		- high plankton production
- **Oceanic Period:**
	- September and October, with about a month of extended leeway
	- end of northwest winds and southward water flow; inshore and northward flows of subtropical water allowed
	- annual highs for water temperature and salinity; low plankton production
	- 15.6\*C; warms during El Niño events
- **Davidson Countercurrent:**
	- cc: a subsurface back eddy on the current which flows north between current and shore
	- period in winter alongside winter storms
	- low plankton production
	- low surface salinity; storm runoff
	- low temperatures and evaporation rates
	- “negative upwelling”/downwelling caused by south/onshore winds
	- in intense periods, causes warm off-coast temperatures and high rainfall
- periods are overlaid by local gyres and currents: Gulf of Farallones, etc.
