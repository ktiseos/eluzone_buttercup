- **vascular plants** via plumbing (grass, trees, cabbage) vs. algae
	- generic term plant
	- seaweed algae synonymous; kelp are a specific member of algae
- microhabitat: a neighborhood, local terrain and ecosystem
	- sub 1km
	- california focus
	- different physical conditions
- varied topography
	- shell sand strips, horizontal streaks
	- rock bench
	- watery channels
	- white-plate clusters on exposed beach
	- silty and damp
- a book about how plants and animals of different body designs live where they do, not why they have those designs or why they live there
- no phylogenetics, evolutionary history; how the structure of a plant or animals affects its performance of specific functions but not evolution
- different effects determine where an intertidal organism lives
	- physical conditions able to tolerate
	- organismal interactions
	- predation
	- outcompetition and abundancy
	- human effects and environmental changes
	- spatial patterns
- biophysics: the physics of living things (molecular movement and change)
	- biophysical ecologists study physical conditions, effects of living things on physical conditions, mechanisms used for survival
	- intuitive biophysics; non-scientific jargon

- eddy: a circular vortex of fluid diffusing biomaterial
- substratum: solid surface where an organism resides
- water needs to constantly flow; needs to have constant incurred substances, change of nutrients and waste concentration
- colonize on coast rafting in water
- local speed determines where sediment is deposed and deposited
