# key definitions in music
## textures
- defines how melody and harmony are interwoven
primarily monophonic, homophonic, and polyphonic textures to music
- **monophony** — one single “voice” forming a melody, without pitches and variations added to the melody
- **homophony** — a main melody accompanied by played or sung variations, creating a harmony
	- the melody is the “part you remember”; homophony is added with additional chords (think of a Mozart piece)
- **polyphony** — various melodies occurring at the same time; a melody and a countermelody
	- the same lyrics staggered over time ( “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” ) or two independent melodies (Bach)
	- often uses imitation (restatements of a melody)
other variations
- **heterophony** — variations of the same melody
- **homorhythm** — when all melody and harmony moves with the same rhythmic pattern; the melody and harmony are different, but move on the same timing
## basic definitions for melody
- **pitch** — the high or low attribute of a sound
- **melody** — a line or tune in music comprised of different pitches with differing intervals
- **intervals** — the distance between two notes
- **range** — how many different notes are present in the melody, or the traveling distance between the pitches of the notes; wide or narrow range of notes
- **phrase** — a line of the melody (a line in the **stanza**)
## melody
- **conjunct** — the intervals of the melody are close together, making it easy to sing and play
	- “Mary Had a Little Lamb”
- **disjunct** — the intervals of the melody are further apart and make it slightly more difficult to sing/play
	- “Star-Spangled Banner”
- melodies have different **shapes**; drawn with **contours** on sheets
	- **wave-like** — conjunct, narrow variations
		- “Ode to Joy”
		- may remain wave-like even when disjunct
	- **descending** — wider range, but may still be conjunct
		- “Joy to the World”
	- melodic motion
- **cadence** — a resting point in the music, such as at the end of a phrase
- **countermelody** — a melody that exists independent and against another melody
# w1
- ancient greeks emphasized vocals – ethos
- christians – worry of sensuality
- greek healing properties to body and mind; divine

- rome conquering greece → adopted greek theory → modern widespread in western music theory
- most modern evolutions from medieval music
- medieval music had no separation between sacred and secular; music educated by church
- music in background idea from greek; seen esp. in movies
- well-educated and upper class people necessary to have musical education
## ancient greek music
- monophonic
- sometimes embellished/punctuated with but not enhanced by instruments
- improvised (no system of written notation) based on prevailing style of the day
- melody and rhythm linked to ancient greek poetry
- words were considered the most important thing, and singing was constructed around it
- plato: song made up of speech, rhythm, and “harmony”
	- harmony: a sensible melody with an agreeable range of pitches
- lyric poem: sung to a lyre
- ethos: ethical character or manner of behavior
	- music was thought to influence ethos
	- mathematical relations behind musical relationships
	- aristotle’s theory of imitation: certain musical characteristics lead to human imitation of these characteristics
- balance music with gymnastics
	- gymnastics: athletics, preparing the body to allow the mind to receive information
- Pythagoras: music and numbers intertwined
	- rhythm and poetic meter interlinked
	- broke music down into ratio: intervals such as the octave (the same note eight notes apart, with one higher than the other; 2:1), the fifth (3:2), the fourth (4:3)
	- scales organized on these ideas: tetracords
- Aristoxenus, Cleonides theories
- tetracord: a four note section of a scale (seven notes or eight notes that end on the same pitch)
	- ancient: descending order scales
	- modern: ascending order
	- two tetracords placed together to create different combinations
	- only the outer notes of tetracords were fixed
	- position of inner notes determined genus of tetracords
		- diatonic
		- enharmonic
		- chromatic
- plato: beauty exists to remind of divine beauty
	- church music must be as beautiful as possible to inspire to think of the beauty of divinity
- boethius
	- most revered medieval musical theorist

- instruments
	- aulos: double pipe
		- deer bone and mediterranean cane
		- single tube, wide bores
		- strength for outdoor accompaniment
		- narrow range; one note apart between pipe ranges; overlap, ability to perform dissonance vs. offset pipes
	- kithara: concert lyre
- homeric music: earliest possible reconstructed music
	- iliad
## early christian church
- a capella: accompanied by no music; group of people singing at once
	- “in the manner of the chapel”

- chant
	- monophonic
	- sung mostly in Latin; regional chants in southern Europe, but most remaining chant is in Latin
		- most important; written down
	- non-metric: irregular “pulse”, freeform, text determines meter/rhythm
	- first kind of music formally preserved for history; notation was developed to preserve chant
		- crude, but origin of notation system
# medieval music
## sacred music
- gregorian chant
	- sacred style of singing used in medieval era

- three different styles of text settings
	- syllabic: one note per syllable
	- melismatic: several notes per syllable
		- melisma: decoration
	- pneumatic: partial melismatic, partial syllabic
- chant melodies reflect word inflection and rhythm
	- matches divisions in text/word
