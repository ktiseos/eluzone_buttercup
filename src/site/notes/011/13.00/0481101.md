# early overview
- vocal music constitutes the majority of remaining preserved antique music
- antique vocal music is mostly produced by elite and literate classes in antique society
- opinions on singing reflected cultural changes
	- ancient Greece stressed vocal music over instrumental due to ethos
	- middle age Christian conflict over vocal sensuality
	- 16thc significance in Italy for grace, nobility, and cosmic link/harmony
- ancient Near East (Babylonia, Mesopotamia, regions between Mediterranean and Persian Gulf) were similar to modern music: wedding songs, funeral dirges, military marches, work songs, nursery songs, dance music, tavern songs, banquet music, devotion/ceremony music, stories/hymns
- Plato: ideal state is founded on suitable, select music
	- Timotheus with four additional strings alarmed citizens/law
	- “lawlessness in art → anarchy in society”
- Greek musical thought transferred via Boethius west; most revered authority in music
	- rule of Saint Benedict preserved classical learning and spread Latin civilization → literate Gregorian chant formed
- Carolingian rulers in the 8th century → no secular religious separation
	- → Charlemagne crowned by pope of Western Roman Empire in Rome
	- Roman chant was imported from Italy across the Alps through the empire alongside Roman art, architecture, manuscript
	- Gregorian chant was “imposed” on Christian liturgy and specifically preserved
- notation, polyphony, etc. originated in church music; most were trained via Church-led schools
	- notation in 9thc; developments in church increased accuracy of notation
- three successors to the Roman Empire
	- Byzantine Empire in Asia Minor and SE Europe — direct successor
		- preserved Greek/Roman science, architecture, culture + writings/scribe copies
	- Arab — strongest and most vibrant: modern Pakistan thru SWANA + Spain
		- extensions of Greek philosophy and science
		- fostering trade/industry
		- contributions to medicine, chemistry, technology, mathematics
		- patronage for the arts
	- western Europe — weakest, poorest, most fragmented
		- Charlemagne

- modern nations emerged in west Europe following death of Charlemagne’s son, Louis I the Pious
	- west: France + noble regions
	- east: German → Holy Roman Empire
		- included Netherlands and north Italy
		- regional nobility competed via musical arts, fueling development from 9c – 19c

# antiquity music
- Western music developed through Near East and Mediterranean civilizations
- only ~45 Greek songs and hymns survived
- Greco-Roman musical heritage transmitted via images and descriptions in other arts: antique painting/sculpture artifacts
	- commonalities between Greek music and Western music
	- used in religion, entertainment, and dramatic accompaniment
- Greek music theory, esp. pitch. passed onto Romans in 1-2c
	- expectation to be educated in language and music
	- Nero, other emperors
- incomplete transference via church father and scholar writing/preservation/study
	- spread from Jerusalem → Asia Minor → Africa and Europe while collecting elements from Mediterranean region
	- standardization increased as prestige declined; authority of Rome regarding faith and doctrine
	- regulation and standardization of liturgy and repertoire of Gregorian chant
## greek music
- divine origin of music; gods and demigods invented it
- healed sickness, purified soul, worked miracles
- connection to Hebrew Scriptures’ portrayal of music
- surviving examples mostly derived from late periods
	- *Epitaph of Sekilos*: 1CE on a tombstone
		- scolion made by Sekilos on a tombstone
	- close connection to theory and practice
- monophonic with instrumental embellishments → heterophonic
- mostly improvised; linked to poetry sound and meter
- no evidence of continuity between Greek and early Christian musical practice besides vague minor similarities; compare to strong evidence of influence via philosophy and theory
- Plato: *melos* was made of speech, rhythm, and “harmony”
- lyric: poetry sung to a lyre
- tragedy: ode → art of singing
- hymn, etc: musical terms
- contours of melody matched the changing inflections of the words
- music influenced ethos: ethical character
	- Pythagorean view influenced: human soul was kept composite/harmonmic via numerical relationships, including music and *harmonia* comparison
	- theory of imitation: Aristotle; music affects behavior and imitates passion of the soul, so it can form a habitual behavior
		- avoid melodies expressing softness and indolence and instead listen to melodies that imitate courage and stronger virtues
	- gymnastics and music
		- Plato use of two modes: Dorian and Phrygian; not other modes
			- deplored current styles that used too many notes, complex scales, and incompatible combinations; deplored changing musical conventions
				- Mixolydian: mournful and restrained
				- harmoniai had differences
				- Dorian: composure, midway state
				- Phyrgian: men divinely suffused
		- Aristotle:
			- music can be used for amusement and intellect and education
			- however, music is powerful enough to arouse and relieve given emotions in a person (pity and fear) through catharsis
- ancient Greek musical thought
	- Pythagoras
		- rhythms, poetic meter, etc. inseparable from numbers
		- octave, fifth, and fourth were consonances generated by simple numeric ratios
	- Aristides Quintilianus
	- pitches and numerical relationships, systematic descriptions of musical elements and patterns in composition
	- led to developments towards notes, intervals, scales, modes
		- Aristoxenus, 320 BCE Harmonic Elements
		- Cleonides
	- recognition of consonants and the tetrachord
		- four notes that lasted a fourth interval
	- three genera of tetrachord: diatonic, chromatic, enharmonic; wide variation of expression and nuance
		- enharmonic: smaller than semitone intervals
	- *harmonia*: the unification of parts into an orderly whole
- harmonics: study and discipline of ppitch
- numerical proportions underlie systems of musical intervals and heavenly bodies; modes/notes corresponded to planets, distances, and movement
	- Plato: “the music of the spheres” ; unheard music produced by harmonious relationships among planets while revolving
	- later: Middle Ages defined music as discipline which deals with numbers as related to sound; proportion and number were connected to theological understanding
		- learning that led to the contemplation of philosophy
		- place of honor alongside astronomy; explained observations of the senses, things known through speculation, and things too divine to be known (sound, movement of heavenly bodies, mysteries of human soul)
	- persisted through Renaissance into modern era influencing astronomers, physicians, architects, poets
		- ties to astrology
		- Venus and Mercury hold sway for musical attributes of humans in astrological symbolism; musical instruments depicted in medieval/Renaissance work
## roman music
- 200 bce – 500 ce
- greek island → roman province in 146 bce
- lyric poetry was sung
- music incorporated into public religious, military ceremonies, theatre and entertainment, education
- imported Greek culture into Rome; virtuosos, large choruses and orchestras, grand music festivals/competition
	- economic decline and lack of production countered any importance on European developments
- splintered into fragments
## early Christian Church
- grew during decline of Roman Empire
- civilizing and unifying peoples; writing in Greek and Latin on the power of music to inspire divine thoughts and influence imitation in character
- establishment of the papacy’s strength
- majority believed music was not enjoyed just for sounds; platonic principle that beautiful things exist to remind of divine beauty
	- some believed pagan arts were allowed but concerned over pleasure in listening; Augustine
- ancient theory and philosophy following invasion and collapse of Roman Empire was transmitted to West during early Christian era: Martianus Capella and Boethius
	- *The Marriage of Mercury and Philology*
		- seven liberal arts: grammar, dialectic/logic, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, harmonics/music
		- first three: *trivium*; last four: *quadrivium*: verbal arts and mathematical disciplines
		- music numeric relationships explained the universe and cosmic harmony
- Boethius
	- 480-524 ca
	- *De institutione musica*: Fundamentals of Music
	- compiled from Nicomachus treatise and Ptolemy’s *Harmonics*
	- based on statements in Greek mathematics and music theory
	- three types: *musica mundana, musica huymana, musica instrumentalis*
		- *mundana*: cosmic music; inaudible numeric relationships of cosmic harmony, planetary movement, seasons, combining elements
		- *humana:* harmonizing and unifying the body and soul
		- *instrumentalis:* audible music; exemplifies same principles of order as the other types of music due to numerical ratios
		- music had an important place in the education of the young: both in its own merit and as an introduction to advanced philosophical studies
		- *instrumentalis* was the third and lowest category; music was primarily seen as a science and examining the diversity in sounds through the reason and senses, less as a practice
			- a true musician is a theorist and critic who could use reason
- early church practice (2-3c): music was the servant of religion; not cultivated for enjoyment or public spectacles
	- incorporate facets of Greek music and other cultures on the border of the Mediterranean Sea
	- wanted to wean music and converts away from pagan past; 1000+ years of Christian music composed of unaccompanied singing
- Christian observances derived from Jewish traditions
	- Scripture chant, psalm singing, praise poems in Old Testament Book of Psalms
	- parallels between Jewish temple service and Christian Mass through sacrifice of burnt offerings and metaphorical bread and wine
	- vocal music used as worship; banned after destruction of second temple in 70ce for mourning
	- Last Supper in Mass; festive Jewish Passover Seder → psalm-singing
	- singing psalms on certain days: central element in Christian observances
- absorbed other influences: Jerusalem, Asia Minor, North Africa, Europe
	- Syrian churches and monasteries: psalmsinging and strophic devotional songs/hymns
	- singing of devotional songs: earliest recorded musical activity of Jesus and followers
	- psalms and praise traveled via Syria → Asia Minor Byzantium → Italy Milan → other Western centers
- 395 CE division into East/West empires (Byzantium/Rome) → East/West church
- West → Roman Catholic Church + pope bishop of Rome
	- diffusion of Latin liturgy and music: 5th and 6th centuries
		- texts were preserved; melodies changed
		- large independence across local churches; different reception of Roman heritage/origin including Latin liturgies
		- different melodies (chants) in modern Italy, France, and Germany btwn 5-8c; chant dialects
			- Gaul (modern France) → Gallican chant
			- southern Italy → Beneventan
			- Rome → Old Roman
			- Spain → Visigothic/Mozarabic
			- Milanic area → Ambrosian
		- most were absorbed into uniform Romanized practice between 13th to 16thc; Roman Catholic church central authority
			- preserved chant through Frankish monk and nun preservation (modern-day Switzerland, France, western Germany) via song practice and manuscript notation
			- melodies were preserved as Gregorian chant
- Byzantium (Constantinople, Istanbul); Europe–Asia Minor crossroad; capital of E.E. for 1000+ years until 1452 invasion by Turks; cultural center on northern rim of Mediterranean Sea
	- blend of Western, African, Eastern civilizations
		- Byzantine church → Orthodox churches
		- Greek rites → north Slavic cultures; Russian and Slavic Orthodox churches
		- variation in liturgies across Eastern Empire
		- Byzantine musical practices → Western chant through classification of repertory into eight modes/melody types and several hymns borrowed by West in 6 and 9c
- - -
1. music consisted of a single melodic line (monophony)
2. vocal melody was linked to rhythm and meter of text
3. music was improvised according to convention (not notated)
4. philosophical connections to nature, order, and thought
5. scientifically based acoustical theory (Greek)
6. scales used tetrachords (Greek)
7. developed musical terminology (Greek)
- many of these hereditary elements were common among other cultures in the ancient world
- transferred through Christian Church and writing

## medieval music theory/practice
- best reflected via treatises during charlemagne and late middle ages vs. speculation in earlier writings
	- boethius reverently spoken; mathematical fundamentals
- established eight modes or toni/tones; developed into 11th century
	- sequence of tones and semitones in a diatonic octave based on a finalis, usually being the last note in the melody
	- identified via numbers and grouped in pairs; authentic and collateral/plagal modees
	- pairs shared same finals (bracketed whole notes in modern notation) but had different ranges; authentic rose above final, plagal below
	- analogous to white-key octave scales on a modern keyboard from defg vs. fourth lower plagals
	- not absolute pitches, but convenient ways to distinguish interval patterns unique to each pair of modes
	- second characteristic tone: tenor/reciting tone, like the psalm tones
	- tenor placement depended on ranges of modes
	- greek names for church modes
	- not conforming to modal theory
- sightsinging: guido of arezzo
	- *ut re mi fa sol la* syllables
	- hexachords
	- beginning on CGF; solmization
		- semitone falls between third and fourth steps, and other steps are whole tones
		- *do* for *ut* and *ti* above *la* in english solfeggio
	- guidonian hand by followers; intervals sung while pointing to different joints on an open left hand, with each joint standing for twenty notes; other notes were “outside the hand”
- early musical notation developed
	- note symbols/neumes placed above text at varying heights to indicate relative size and direction
	- changed to scratching horizontal line corresponding to note and orienting neumes around line
	- guido 11c: arrange lines and spaces to form modern staff
		- freed from need for oral transmission
## medieval secular monody

	- jongleurs: traveled alone or in small groups performing for money
		- social outcasts denied law and sacraments
	- minstrels in 11c organized into brotherhoods, then musician guilds (ala conservatories)
- troubadours and trobairitz: poet-composers in 12c in southern france
	- provencal; langue d’oc/occitan
	- trouveres were equivalent in northern france
	- theory: troubadours took inspiration from arabic love poetry spread in moorish spain while trouveres spoke langue d’oil, medieval french dialect leading to modern french; troubadour inspiration then spread northward
	- no well-defined group; varied between castle/nobility, courts, craftsmen and jongleurs in aristocratic circles
	- sang songs by self or gave performances to minstrels
	- preserved in *chansonnier* songbooks; 2,600 survive; ⅒th with melodies
		- ⅔ of 2100 trouvere poems have music
		- none others with large repertoire survived
- varied/ingenue structures; simple, dramatic, miming and dancing
	- dance songs included refrain sung by a chorus
	- refrain: line or 2 lines of poetry which returns across stanzas with unique music
	- troubadours wrote complaints on love, politics and morality, stories, and debates/arguments on esoteric chivalric/courtly love
	- particular genres: alba (dawn song), canso (love song), and tenson (debate song)
	- occitan old songs openly sensual or hid via *fine amour* (refined love/coded language); lofty and unattainable image
- courtly example: *Can vei la lauzeta mover*, Bernart de Ventadorn
- typical text was strophic, syllabic with short melismas, opportunity for improvised ornamentation/variation
	- narrow range; sixth to an octave
	- finals on CDF; coherence amongst troubadour texts
	- no particular rhythm known; free/unmeasured or long-short based on inflection were possible; now often transcribed like plainchant, neutral without bars
	- poetic lines received unique melodic phrases and formed one whole melody/one whole stanza
	- other texts included AAB free style
	- modified phrases with repetition with echoes of earlier phrases
- *A chantar* by Comtessa Beatriz de Día; ababcdb 4 melodic phrases
- troubadours were model for German knightly poet-musicians: Minnesingers
	- flourished between 12-14c
	- love was *Minne*; Minnelieder → love song
	- abstract love with religious undertones; sober tones
	- some melodies written in church modes, some in major scales; commonly believed to be common rhythm and triple meter
