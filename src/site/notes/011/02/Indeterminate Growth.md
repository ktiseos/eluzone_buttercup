**Indeterminate growth** is the ability of an [[Organisms\|organism]] to grow and develop further [[Module\|modules]] infinitely so long as it is provided with the resources to successfully develop, such as nutrients and water. This pattern of growth occurs in the [[Vegetative\|vegetative]] structure of [[Plants\|plants]] and rarely occurs in animals; animals are more likely to undergo [[Determinate Growth\|determinate growth]].

Animals are unlikely to undergo indeterminate growth because the majority of their cells divide a finite number of times in development. Of the remainder that can divide an infinite number of times, [[Stem Cells\|stem cells]], few different cell types can be produced. Comparatively, plants maintain [[011/02/Meristems\|Meristems]] throughout their entire lives that allow regions to undergo infinite cell division. So long as these meristems are intact and supplied with nutrients and resources, new modules can develop.
