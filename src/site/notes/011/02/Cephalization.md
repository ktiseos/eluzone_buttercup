**Cephalization** is an evolutionary trend in which sensory and [[Nervous Tissues\|nervous]] [[011/02/Organs\|organs]] are placed in the [[Anterior\|anterior]] region of an [[Organisms\|organism]]. This creates a “[[Cephalic Region\|cephalic region]]” at the anterior, forming a head and a [[Brain\|brain]]. Due to the focus of an anterior (and by proxy, a posterior) region, cephalization is commonly seen in organisms alongside [[Bilateral Symmetry\|bilateral symmetry]]. Bilaterally symmetric organisms [[Locomotion\|locomote]] head-first and thus require their sensory and nervous organs to be at their anterior. As such, it is one of the characteristic traits of members of the [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clade]] [[Bilatera\|Bilatera]].
