The [[011/02/Leaves\|leaves]] of a [[011/02/Vascular Plants\|vascular plant]] are **whorled** if three or more leaves are attached to each [[011/02/Plant Nodes\|node]] of the stem. The term whorl refers to a circular, ovular, or arced shape; the leaves attach to the node on a lateral plane. This phenomenon is also known as a **verticil**.
