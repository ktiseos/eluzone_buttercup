A **columnar** [[Cells\|cell]] is an [[011/02/Epithelial Tissues\|epithelial tissue cell]] that is rectangular and longer on one axis than the other.

In a [[011/02/Stratified Epithelial Tissues\|stratified epithelial tissue]], columnar tissue cells tend to be found in the innermost layers which are closer to the [[Basement Membrane\|basement membrane]]. As time progresses, the columnar cells are pushed upwards like [[Strata\|strata]] and are compressed into [[011/02/Cuboidal\|cuboidal]], then [[011/02/Squamous\|squamous]] cells.
