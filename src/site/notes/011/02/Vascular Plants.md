**Vascular plants** are an informal, non-[[011/02/Taxonomy\|taxonomical]] classification of [[Land Plants\|land plants]]. They are one of the broadest classifications for land plants alongside [[011/02/Bryophytes\|bryophytes]]. Compared to bryophytes, all vascular plants possess some form of [[Vascular Tissue\|vascular tissue]], allowing extensive mineral and water transport through the plant for development and growth.

Vascular plants can be loosely categorized by whether or not they produce [[Seeds\|seeds]]. There are two subgroups of [[Seedless Vascular Plants\|seedless vascular plants]]: lycophytes and monilophytes. There are also two subgroups of [[Seed Plants\|seed plants]]: [[011/02/Gymnosperms\|gymnosperms]] and [[011/02/Angiosperms\|angiosperms]]. Vascular plants include [[011/02/Woody Plants\|woody plants]], such as trees; flowering plants, such as fruits; and horsetails and ferns.
