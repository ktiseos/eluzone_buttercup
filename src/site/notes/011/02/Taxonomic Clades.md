A **clade** is a collection of [[011/02/Taxonomy\|taxa]] who share a collective [[011/02/Taxonomy\|taxonomic]] ancestor. These collections are also referred to as **phyletic groups** as they are used in [[011/02/Phylogenetics\|phylogeny]] (hence their name, *phyl-*, rather than in reference to a *[[Phyla\|phylum]]*) to trace [[Common Ancestor\|common ancestors]], [[011/02/Evolutionary Traits\|traits]], and evolutionary history.

A clade may take one of three forms of phyletic groups. It is ideal and emphasized that a clade should be a **[[011/02/Monophyletic Groups\|monophyletic group]]**. In this case, and in many cases across this site, the definition of a monophyletic group is synonymous with that of a clade.

However, a clade may also be **[[011/02/Paraphyletic Groups\|paraphyletic]]** or **[[011/02/Polyphyletic Groups\|polyphyletic]].** These groups are not ideal and are often created by accident; they result from a lack of information and evidence.
