**Homology** is the observation of one of three types of [[move later/Biology\|biological]] similarities shared among [[011/02/Taxa\|taxa]] due to sharing a [[Common Ancestor\|common ancestor]]. This is in part the scientific explanation backing [[011/02/Charles Darwin\|Charles Darwinâ€™s]] [[011/02/Evolutionary History\|observations while he was on board the HMS Beagle]].

The three types of homologies are broad categories with respects to different aspects of biology: structural, genetic, and developmental homology. **Structural homology** pertains to the body plan and anatomy of taxa; **genetic homology** to the chromosomal makeup and molecular sequence of taxa; and **developmental homology** to the embryonic structure and growth of taxa.
