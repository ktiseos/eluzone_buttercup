An **ingroup** is a [[011/02/Phylogenetics\|phylogenetic]] [[011/02/Taxa\|taxon]] which is being studied in the main phylogeny. A phylogeny has several ingroups with are related to one another due to being a part of the same lineage being studied. These ingroups are compared for their evolutionary differences to the [[011/02/Outgroups\|outgroup]], a lineage which has been chosen for being distinct to an extent from the primary lineage.
