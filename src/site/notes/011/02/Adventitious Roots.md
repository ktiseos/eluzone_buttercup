**Adventitious roots** are [[Roots\|roots]] that grow from the [[Hypocotyl\|hypocotyl]] region of the [[011/02/Stems\|stem]] of a [[011/02/Vascular Plants\|vascular plant]]. In general, adventitious refers to any [[011/02/Organs\|organ]] that grows in an unusual place anatomically, such as the stem compared to the [[Primary Root\|primary root]], [[Taproot\|taproot]], or [[011/02/Radicle\|radicle]] of a plant (which make up the typical [[011/02/Root System\|root system]]). These roots are formed approximately the same diameter.

Adventitious roots are minor roots in plants that utilize a [[011/02/Taproot System\|taproot system]], such as all [[011/02/Eudicots\|eudicots]], and are major roots in all plants that utilize a [[Fibrous Root System\|fibrous root system]], such as all [[011/02/Monocots\|monocots]]. In the latter category of the plants, the primary and lateral roots grown from the radicle die off; instead, the adventitious roots comprise the entire fibrous root system.
