An **outgroup** is a [[011/02/Phylogenetics\|phylogenetic]] [[011/02/Taxa\|taxon]] which is determined to be distantly enough related from the remaining taxa that comprise the [[011/02/Ingroups\|ingroups]]. It must be closely related to the same lineage and thus possess a [[Common Ancestor\|common ancestor]] with the ingroups, but it must possess enough differences to deem it an outgroup. Outgroups can be determined based on scientific data gained from morphology, paleontology, embryology, and gene sequencing.
