The **microvilli** (*sg.* microvillus) are microscopic projections in the [[011/02/Brush Border\|brush border]] of the [[Cellular Membrane\|cellular membrane]]. Microvilli are encased in the [[Plasma Membrane\|plasma membrane]] and appear as microscopic folds in the [[011/02/Cells\|cellular]] membrane.

The term microvilli is a combination of the prefix *micro-* and the term *villus*, which is derived from a Latin word that refers to a thick tuft of hair comparable to fleece.

Like the [[011/02/Villi\|villi]], who are similarly named, the microvilli are used to extend the [[Surface Area\|surface area]] of the cellular membrane lining. This increases the space for and the productivity of [[Transport Proteins\|transport proteins]] for [[Nutrients\|nutrient]] [[Absorption\|absorption]]
