A **ground substance** is a dense material found in the [[011/02/Matrix\|matrix]] of [[011/02/Connective Tissues\|connective tissues]] made from a combination of [[Glycoproteins\|glycoproteins]] and [[Polysaccharides\|polysaccharides]]. This results in it taking a liquid or gelatinous property. The ground substance separates the [[011/02/Tissues\|tissue]] [[011/02/Cells\|cells]] while simultaneously keeping the [[011/02/Proteinaceous Fibers\|proteinaceous fibers]] attached.
