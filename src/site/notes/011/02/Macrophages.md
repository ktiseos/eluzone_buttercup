**Macrophages** are a category of [[Phagocytes\|phagocytic]] [[011/02/Cells\|cells]] that are found in several [[011/02/Organs\|organs]] of the body. They are named for their function (as *phagocytes*) and their relative but distinct size (*macro-*) in comparison to cells such as those found in [[011/02/Connective Tissues\|connective tissues]] such as [[011/02/Loose Connective Tissues\|loose connective tissue]], especially when viewed under a microscope. They are also found in [[011/02/Adipose Tissues\|adipose tissues]].
