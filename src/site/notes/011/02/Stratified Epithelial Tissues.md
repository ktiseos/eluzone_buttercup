**Stratified epithelial tissues** are a type of [[011/02/Epithelial Tissues\|epithelial tissue]] where the [[011/02/Tissues\|tissue]] possesses multiple layers of [[Cells\|cells]]. The adjectival name is derived from the geological concept of [[Strata\|strata]] (*sg.* stratum).

Stratified epithelial tissues possess multiple cell shapes; [[011/02/Columnar\|columnar]] cells are prevalent at the innermost layers, closest to the [[Basement Membrane\|basement membrane]], and compress over time, leading to the prevalence of [[011/02/Squamous\|squamous]] and [[011/02/Cuboidal\|cuboidal]] cells towards the free surface layer. As a result of this variation, when stratified epithelial tissues are named in full, the cell shape term is taken from the cell shape which is present on the free surface layer.

Due to the dense packing of the tissue, stratified epithelial tissues are most commonly found in areas that endure significant amounts of [[Friction\|frictional]] stress or areas that require dense covering. Examples include [[Animals\|animal]] [[Skin\|skin]] and the lining of the [[Mouth\|mouth]] and throat.

[[Pseudostratified Epithelial Tissues\|Pseudostratified epithelial tissues]] are not true stratified epithelial tissues (hence the *pseudo-* prefix). They are a type of [[011/02/Simple Epithelial Tissues\|simple epithelial tissue]] with one layer of epithelial cells.
