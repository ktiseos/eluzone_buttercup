**Hyaline cartilage** is a specific type of [[011/02/Cartilage\|cartilage]], a [[011/02/Connective Tissues\|connective tissue]]. It is known and named for its pearl-grey, glass or fog-like appearance derived from the composition of its [[011/02/Matrix\|matrix]].

Hyaline cartilage’s [[011/02/Ground Substance\|ground substance]] is made from [[Chondrin\|chondrin]] and is filled randomly with individual [[Collagen\|collagenous]] [[011/02/Proteinaceous Fibers\|fibers]]. The collagen in specific gives it its glassy appearance. It also comprises most of the cartilage, densely packing the [[011/02/Tissues\|tissue]]. Although it is mostly solid, the chondrin has small [[Lacunae\|lacunae]] which store the [[Chondrocytes\|chondrocyte]] [[011/02/Cells\|cells]]. This solidity makes material [[Diffusion\|diffuse]] slowly through the chondrin, as there are no [[Blood Vessels\|blood vessels]] in the tissue.

Hyaline cartilage is smooth and semi-flexible. It is found cushioning several [[Bone\|bones]] of the body, such as the end of the elbow, other limbs, and the ribs. It also makes up several [[011/02/Organs\|organs]] such as the bridge of the nose, the larynx, and the rings of the trachea found on the front side of the neck. It can be found adjacent to [[011/02/Adipose Tissues\|adipose tissue]].

Etymologically, hyaline cartilage derives from the adjective *hyaline*, which means glassy, transparent, or amorphous. The term originates from the Latin term *hyalinus*, in turn from ὑάλινος (*tl. huálinos* for an adjectival crystal or glass.)
