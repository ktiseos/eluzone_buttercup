**Angiosperms** are a [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clade]] of [[Seed Plants\|seed plants]]. They produce [[Seeds\|seeds]] for [[Sexual Reproduction\|sexual reproduction]]; however, unlike their [[011/02/Sister Groups\|sister]] [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clade]] [[011/02/Gymnosperms\|gymnosperms]], angiosperm seeds are enclosed in a structure known as a [[011/02/Fruit\|fruit]] for protection. In addition, they often produce and utilize [[011/02/Flowers\|flowers]] for protection and attraction in pollination. As such, angiosperms are commonly known as flowering plants and are some of the most prominent and most successful plants found in modern day.

Angiosperms can be divided into two clades based on a variety of [[011/02/Evolutionary Traits\|characteristics]]; they are particularly named for the number of [[011/02/Cotyledons\|cotyledons]] present during development. This list also includes the arrangement of the [[Veins\|veins]] produced by their [[Vascular Tissue\|vascular tissue]], the arrangement of their [[Vascular Bundles\|vascular bundles]], the categorization of their [[011/02/Root System\|root systems]], and the pattern number of [[011/02/Organs\|organs]] developed in the plant flower. These clades are the [[011/02/Monocots\|monocot]] and [[011/02/Eudicots\|eudicot]] (formerly [[Dicots\|dicot]]) clades.

Angiosperms include both [[011/02/Herbs\|Herbs]] and [[011/02/Woody Plants\|woody plants]]. More popular angiosperms include fruits, vegetables, and common “flowers”.
