A **meristem** is a cluster of undifferentiated [[move later/Cells\|cells]] in a [[Plants\|plant]]. Meristems are capable of cell division even after the [[Embryo\|embryo]] has matured and are used for different types of growth in plants. There are two kinds of meristems: [[011/02/Apical Meristems\|apical meristems]] and [[011/02/Lateral Meristems\|lateral meristems]]. These meristems facilitate [[Primary Tissues\|primary tissue]] growth and [[Secondary Tissues\|secondary tissue]] growth respectively within the plant.
