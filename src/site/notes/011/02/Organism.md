An **organism** is a categorical level of organization on the macroscopic level pertaining to [[011/02/Biology\|biological]] organisms. One organism is defined as any individual living entity. Typically, an organism has multiple [[011/02/Organs\|organs]] which are specialized to perform different functions that the organism requires to survive. Animals typically also categorize these organs into [[011/02/Organ Systems\|organ systems]], while prokaryotic organisms like bacteria and archaea have no organ systems, let alone organs.

Regardless of these differences between domains and [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clades]], a group of the same organism in an approximate location is known as a [[011/02/Biological Population\|population]].
