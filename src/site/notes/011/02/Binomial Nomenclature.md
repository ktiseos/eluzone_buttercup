**Binomial nomenclature** is a [[011/02/Taxonomy\|taxonomical]] system that was invented by [[Carolus Linnaeus\|Carolus Linnaeus]]. Under the system of binomial nomenclature, all [[Organisms\|organisms]] are given a two-word scientific name. The first word corresponds to the [[Genera\|genus]] which the organism belongs to; the second is denoted as the “specific epithet” which is exclusive to that [[Species\|species]]. Binomial nomenclature is a subset of [[011/02/Linnaean Taxonomy\|Linnaean taxonomy]] which addresses the lowest ranks in the taxonomic structure: genera and species.

To refer to an organism via binomial nomenclature, one needs to follow a set of rules.
1. The genus name precedes the specific epithet.
2. The genus is capitalized, and the specific epithet is not capitalized.
3. The full name is italicized or underlined (typically italicized via digital media.)

In order to create a scientific name, one must also follow another set of rules.
1. The genus name is usually a widely-accepted name, not one which is created for the species. One is usually creating a specific epithet in this event.
2. The name must be “Latinized”. See the above quote as written by the authors of *Campbell Biology*, 12th edition. It must even follow grammatical convention for Latin, even if its root word is not Latin in origin.
3. One should not name a species after themselves.
