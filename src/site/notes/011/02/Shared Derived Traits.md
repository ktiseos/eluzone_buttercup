A **shared derived trait** is a [[011/02/Evolutionary Traits\|trait]] that evolved in descendant [[011/02/Sister Groups\|sister]] [[011/02/Taxa\|taxa]] within a [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clade]]. A change occurred that caused the [[011/02/Evolution\|evolution]] of a different trait within the derivative [[Organisms\|organisms]]. This may be referred to as an “evolutionary novelty.”
