The **endosperm** is a layer of endoskeletal [[011/02/Tissues\|tissue]] found in many [[011/02/Angiosperms\|angiosperm]] [[Embryo\|embryos]]. It surrounds the sperm inside the embryo. This layer is full of nutrients which are used to support the [[Seeds\|seed]] after germination. It is protected by a [[Seed Coat\|seed coat]] and the [[011/02/Fruit\|fruit]], preventing it from being damaged and harming necessary resources for the embryo.

Large endosperms are typically found in [[011/02/Monocots\|monocots]] like corn and grain. These endosperms comprise the majority of the seed, occupying space that the embryo does not fill. While their counterpart is the [[011/02/Cotyledons\|cotyledon]] or cotyledons in other monocots and the [[011/02/Eudicots\|eudicots]], many plants that do not rely solely on the endosperm still depend on it during germination. The embryo may at some point absorb the endosperm; if this occurs, the embryo will store its food in a cotyledon after maturation.
