A **simple leaf** is a [[011/02/Leaves\|leaf]] whose [[011/02/Leaf Blade\|blade]] is not subdivided into smaller [[Leaflets\|leaflets]]. All [[011/02/Vascular Plants\|vascular plants]] possess at least one or two simple leaves; these leaves are the [[011/02/Cotyledons\|cotyledons]] that were present during embryonic development. Vascular plants will always develop these leaves, even if the “true” leaves that develop afterwards are [[011/02/Compound Leaves\|compound leaves]].

Simple leaves are usually not flattened, but sometimes may be.
