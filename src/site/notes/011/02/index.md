The **16-litre primordial soup pot** is a silly term coined to describe a vat of college-level [[011/001/Permanent Notes\|permanent notes]] primarily associated with [[Biology\|biology]] and the trademark beating heart of my silly knowledge kitchen.

The soup pot is a loose umbrella-style metaphor to encompass works written in the [[011/001/Zettelkasten\|Zettelkasten]] method and [[011/001/Digital Gardening\|Digital Gardening]] mindset; rigidity is the last thing on the archive’s mind.
