A **bulb** is a group of [[011/02/Leaves\|leaves]] in a [[011/02/Herbs\|herbaceous]] [[011/02/Vascular Plants\|vascular plant]] that have been modified to store food. In plants that possess a bulb, the leaves have been modified to become scale-like and fleshy, and they store the food in a grouping over the [[011/02/Stems\|stem]] and [[Roots\|roots]] of the plant.

Bulbs are buried underground alongside the rest of the plant and aid [[Biennials\|biennial]] and [[Perennials\|perennial]] [[011/02/Fruit\|fruits]]. They can be differentiated from [[011/02/Corms\|corms]], a similar modification of plant [[011/02/Organs\|organs]], from the presence of vertical lines. These lines show the separation and layering of the scales.

Both [[011/02/Eudicots\|eudicots]] and [[011/02/Monocots\|monocots]] make bulbs, but they are seen more often in monocots. Examples of these monocots include onions, garlic, and cloves.
