**Parenchyma** is an ambiguate term for different forms of [[011/02/Tissues\|tissues]] in [[Botany\|botany]] and [[Zoology\|zoology]].

Zoological [[Organisms\|organisms]] in the [[Phyla\|phylum]] [[011/02/Platyhelminthes\|Platyhelminthes]] possess a loose, sponge-like tissue which fills the unused pockets of the body that is referred to as **parenchyma**. It is referred to as a “filler” tissue which makes up the remainder of the platyhelminth.

In botany, plants possess **parenchyma tissue**, a tissue found in the [[Ground Tissue System\|ground tissue system]].  Parenchyma is a [[Simple Tissue\|simple tissue]] composed of **parenchyma cells**. When mature, parenchyma [[011/02/Cells\|cells]] are living cells with evenly thin [[011/02/Primary Cell Wall\|primary cell walls]] and a [[011/02/Middle Lamella\|middle lamella]]. They are usually [[Isodiametric\|isodiametrically]] shaped, or [[011/02/Cuboidal\|cuboidal]]; in some cases, they are [[Elongate\|elongate]], such as when they are in [[011/02/Leaves\|leaf]] tissue. They have approximately 25 micrometers of air space between them and neighboring cells in order to maintain gas exchange.

Parenchyma cells are primarily used in photosynthetic and metabolic processes. In leaves, when they are a part of [[Mesophyll\|mesophyll]], they contain [[011/02/Chloroplasts\|chloroplasts]] and produce sugars for the plant. In other [[011/02/Organs\|organs]], such as the [[Roots\|roots]], they aid in cell respiration. Parenchyma cells are versatile and can also be used for storage, cell growth, or to maintain turgor pressure. They can even revert to a [[011/02/Meristems\|meristematic]] state to divide and produce new cells, such as if wounds in the plant need to be repaired.
