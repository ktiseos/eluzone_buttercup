In [[Microbiology\|microbiology]], a **cross-section** refers to a specimen that has been cut in a way perpendicular to one of its axes. This cut creates a two-dimensional view parallel to the structures of the specimen. In comparison to a [[Whole Mount\|whole mount]], the cross-section of a specimen can reveal the internal structure of a specimen that is not easily seen by the human or [[Microscopes\|microscopic]] eye.
