**Monocots** are a [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clade]] of [[011/02/Angiosperms\|angiosperms]]. They are named for having one [[011/02/Cotyledons\|cotyledon]] while the [[Embryo\|embryo]] develops, although they share additional differences to their [[011/02/Sister Groups\|sister]] [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clade]], the [[011/02/Eudicots\|Eudicots]].

Monocots can also be differentiated via the observation of parallel [[Veins\|veins]] in the [[011/02/Leaves\|leaves]]; a “haphazard”, but complex arrangement of [[Vascular Bundles\|vascular bundles]] in the [[011/02/Stems\|stem]] and [[011/02/Shoot System\|shoot]] [[Cells\|cells]]; the observation of a [[Fibrous Root System\|fibrous root system]]; and a pattern of producing flowering [[011/02/Organs\|organs]] in threes.

Monocots include various [[011/02/Herbs\|herbaceous]] and [[011/02/Woody Plants\|woody plants]] such as corn, grasses, lilies, and palm trees. However, woody monocots do not undergo [[Secondary Tissues\|secondary tissue]] growth, as they lack [[Vascular Cambium\|vascular cambium]] [[011/02/Tissues\|tissue]].
