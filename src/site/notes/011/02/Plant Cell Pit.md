A **pit** is a gap in the [[011/02/Secondary Cell Wall\|secondary cell wall]] of a cell, or a region of a [[Cell Walls\|cell wall]] in which the secondary cell wall does not deposit. Pits are found in regions where [[011/02/Primary Pit Field\|primary pit fields]] are present; they are used in turn to continue to facilitate the transport of materials across cells even after the secondary cell wall has been deposited.

Pits are usually created after the [[Cellular Membrane\|cell membrane]] has died off.
