[[Classes\|Class]] **Monogenea** is a [[011/02/Monophyletic Groups\|monophyletic]] grouping of the [[Phyla\|phylum]] [[011/02/Platyhelminthes\|Platyhelminthes]]. Monogenea are the only [[Ectoparasitic\|ectoparasitic]] flatworms of the phylum, compared to their [[011/02/Sister Groups\|sister groups]], [[011/02/Trematoda\|Trematoda]] and [[011/02/Cestoda\|Cestoda]], which are both [[Endoparasitic\|endoparasitic]]. Unlike both phyla, Monogenea have a simple [[Life Cycles\|life cycle]] with no intermediate host; over the course of a life cycle, they will only attach to their [[Definitive Host\|definitive host]], which tends to be an aquatic [[Vertebrates\|vertebrate]] such as a marine fish. Adult Monogenea latch onto the [[Epidermis\|epidermis]] of their hosts with suckers and hosts.

Like the class Trematoda, Monogenea are commonly referred to as flukes.
