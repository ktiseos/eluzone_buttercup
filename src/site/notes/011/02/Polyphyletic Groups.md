A **polyphyletic group** is a [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clade]] which excludes the [[Common Ancestor\|common ancestor]], or the [[011/02/Phylogenetic Node\|node]], between [[011/02/Phylogenetic Branch\|branches]] of [[011/02/Taxa\|taxa]]. The removal of this [[011/02/Phylogenetic Node\|node]] removes the precise or accurate depiction of the relation between the studied taxa; consider, as an example, the removal of [[LUCA\|“LUCA”]] from the “Tree of Life”.
