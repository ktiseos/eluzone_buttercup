**Apical meristems** are [[011/02/Meristems\|meristem]] groups found in the tips of the [[011/02/Shoot System\|shoot system]] in [[011/02/Vascular Plants\|vascular plants]]. These areas include all [[011/02/Plant Buds\|plant buds]] and the [[Root Tips\|root tips]] within a [[Plants\|plant]].

Apical meristems facilitate [[Primary Tissues\|primary tissue]] growth within the plant. They lengthen the plant and vertically develop it through the growth of [[Branches\|branches]] and the main [[011/02/Stems\|stem]]. They are essential to the development of plants; plants will not develop without them.
