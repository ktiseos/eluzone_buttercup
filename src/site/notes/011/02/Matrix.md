In [[Biology\|biology]], the **matrix** is a divider made from two forms of [[Extracellular Material\|extracellular material]] which separates [[011/02/Connective Tissues\|connective tissue]] [[Cells\|cells]]. The matrix is made from [[011/02/Proteinaceous Fibers\|proteinaceous fibers]] and a [[011/02/Ground Substance\|ground substance]] which gives it its dense, gelatinous, yet adhesive properties.

All connective tissues possess a matrix, though some aspects of the matrix may be minimized depending on the [[011/02/Tissues\|tissue]]. For example, [[011/02/Dense Connective Tissues\|dense connective tissue]] has far less ground substance compared to [[011/02/Loose Connective Tissues\|areolar connective tissue]]. In many tissues, the matrix is secreted within a [[011/02/Specialization\|specialized]] cell, such as the [[Fibroblasts\|fibroblasts]] of the areolar connective tissue.
