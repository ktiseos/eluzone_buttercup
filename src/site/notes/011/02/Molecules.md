A **molecule** is a categorical level of organization on the atomic level within [[011/02/Biology\|biological]] [[011/02/Organism\|organisms]]. It is the smallest of the structural levels of biological life and is made of two or more atoms. However, a single molecule, or a group of non-organized molecules, is non-living.

A grouping of molecules is known as a [[011/02/Cells\|cell]].
