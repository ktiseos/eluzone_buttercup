An **herb** is a [[011/02/Vascular Plants\|vascular plant]] that undergoes little [[Secondary Growth\|secondary growth]] and develops very little to no [[Secondary Tissues\|secondary tissue]]. It lacks what would commonly be referred to as [[Wood\|wood]] or [[Bark\|bark]]. Plants that are herbs are also called **herbaceous plants**, and the botanical properties exclusive to herbs are described as herbaceous; they are contrasted to [[011/02/Woody Plants\|Woody Plants]].

Many [[011/02/Angiosperms\|Angiosperms]] are herbs; on the other hand, no gymnosperms are herbaceous. Of the angiosperms, most [[Annuals\|annuals]] and [[Biennials\|biennials]] and many [[Perennials\|perennials]] are herbs, but not all.

Herbs include common fruits, vegetables, and spices. Corn is an annual herb; onion is a biennial herb; and mints and strawberries are perennial herbs.
