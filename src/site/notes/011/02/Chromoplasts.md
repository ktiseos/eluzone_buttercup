**Chromoplasts** are a kind of [[011/02/Plastids\|plastid]] found in plants. They are colorful plastids, but notably are never green-colored (see [[011/02/Chloroplasts\|Chloroplasts]]); they tend to be pigmented yellow, orange, or red because they store [[Carotenoids\|carotenoids]] in their [[Thylakoid\|thylakoid]] membrane sacs.

Chromoplasts are most commonly found in [[011/02/Fruit\|fruits]] and [[011/02/Flowers\|flowers]], so they are most often found in [[011/02/Angiosperms\|Angiosperms]].
