**Elastic cartilage** is a kind of [[011/02/Cartilage\|cartilaginous]] [[011/02/Tissues\|tissue]] in the [[011/02/Connective Tissues\|connective tissue]] category. It is known for its particular flexibility as a result of possessing both [[Collagen\|collagenous]] and [[Elastin\|elastic]] [[011/02/Proteinaceous Fibers\|fibers]], having more of the latter than the former. Like other cartilage tissues, it has a [[Chondrin\|chondrin]] [[011/02/Matrix\|matrix]] which makes it semi-solid and hard for materials to [[Diffusion\|diffuse]] through, and its [[Chondrocytes\|chondrocytes]] occupy small [[Lacunae\|lacunae]] within the matrix.

Elastic cartilage is found in more flexible structures of the body such as the external structure of the [[Ear\|ear]].
