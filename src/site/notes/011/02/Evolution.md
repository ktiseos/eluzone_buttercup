> [!quote] “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.” —Theodosius Dobzhansky

**Evolution** is the concept of [[011/02/Biology\|biological]] change in which [[Species\|species]] accumulate [[Variation\|variation]] in their [[011/02/Evolutionary Traits\|traits]] from their [[Ancestry\|ancestors]] as they [[Adaptation\|adapt]] to new [[Environment\|environments]] [[011/02/Gradualism\|over time]]. Evolution explains both biological [[Diversity\|diversity]] and [[Unity\|unity]] among [[011/02/Organism\|organisms]]; affirms scientific data (including [[Fossils\|fossil]] evidence), [[Extinction\|extinction]] events, and according [[011/02/Modern Evolutionary Theory\|theory]]; and disputes the classical belief of [[011/02/Evolutionary History\|perfection in creation]].

Evolution is studied from a [[011/02/Microevolution\|microscopic]] or a [[011/02/Macroevolution\|macroscopic]] standpoint both within and across species over time. Regardless of type, evolution is a [[011/02/Gradualism\|slow, gradual process]] which occurs [[011/02/Uniformitarianism\|repeatedly]] over thousands of years that affects the genetic pool of generations of organisms. The concept of evolution was developed following a [[011/02/Evolutionary History\|long history]] of philosophical thought and viewpoints on the nature and development of biological species.
