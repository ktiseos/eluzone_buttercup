A **branch** is a later connection which depicts a descendant [[011/02/Taxa\|taxon]] from a [[011/02/Phylogenetic Node\|node]] ancestor and an [[011/02/Evolution\|evolution]] at a point in time. Branches may be [[011/02/Node Rotation\|rotated]] around a node so long as they still reflect accurate and identical [[011/02/Phylogenetics\|phylogenetic]] evolution.
