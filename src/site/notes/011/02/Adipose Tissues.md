**Adipose tissues** are a kind of [[011/02/Connective Tissues\|connective tissue]] known for their large [[011/02/Specialization\|specialized]] [[Cells\|cells]] which are both densely packed within the [[011/02/Tissues\|tissue]] and are densely packed themselves with cellular material. These cells are known as [[011/02/Adipocytes\|adipocytes]] and pack [[Triglycerides\|triglycerides]]. Adipose tissues can be recognized by these cells, as their [[011/02/Fat Vacuoles\|fat vacuoles]] used to store these fatty acids are so large and dense that they will push other [[Organelles\|organelles]] to the edges of the cell.

The triglycerides, being the primary material in [[Fat\|body fat]], give the tissue its alias as fat or fatty tissue. They also make the tissue look like chicken wire, as they are colorless in comparison to the other organelles and the thin extracellular [[011/02/Matrix\|matrix]].

Due to the volume of the adipocytes with triglyceride, the matrix makes up very little of the tissue. The few [[011/02/Proteinaceous Fibers\|fibers]] in the matrix are [[Collagen\|collagenous]] in order to hold the adipocytes together.

As the primary component of body fat, adipose tissues are commonly known as storage for high energy triglycerides. One should remember they are also connective tissues and function similarly to [[011/02/Loose Connective Tissues\|loose connective tissues]]: they cushion delicate [[011/02/Organs\|organs]] in the body such as the [[Kidneys\|kidneys]] to protect them from damage, or other tissues such as [[011/02/Hyaline Cartilage\|hyaline cartilage]] which heal slowly after being damaged.
