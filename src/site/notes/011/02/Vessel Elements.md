**Vessel elements** are a kind of [[011/02/Water-Conducting Cells\|water-conducting cell]] which are mostly only found in [[011/02/Angiosperms\|Angiosperms]]. These cells can be stacked to form wide, long pipes, known as vessels, which transport water across the plant; they often are stacked in pipes as small as the length of two cells to 30â€“50 cells long.

Vessel elements are short and wide cells. They have multiple [[011/02/Plant Cell Pit\|pits]] perforating the laterals, sides, and ends of the [[011/02/Secondary Cell Wall\|Secondary Cell Wall]]. Unlike [[011/02/Tracheids\|Tracheids]], they do not taper at both ends; instead, both ends have a large opening known as a [[Perforation Plate\|perforation plate]].

Vessel elements are far more efficient than tracheids. However, they lack [[Pit Membranes\|pit membranes]] and are more susceptible to [[011/02/Gas Embolisms\|embolisms]]; when these occur, the vessels are fully destroyed.
