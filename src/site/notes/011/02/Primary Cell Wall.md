The **primary cell wall** is a [[Cell Walls\|cell wall]] layer found in many living plant cells. It is a thin, semi-firm cell wall found within the [[011/02/Middle Lamella\|middle lamella]] of the cell.

The primary cell wall is composed of a specifically arranged [[011/02/Matrix\|matrix]] which forms the popular cell wall. It is always made from [[011/02/Pectin\|pectins]], [[Cellulose\|cellulose]], and [[Hemicellulose\|hemicellulose]]. In the primary cell wall, coils of cellulose hydrogen-bond to one another, forming a cellulose “cable” or microfibril. These microfibrils overlap with a net of pectins which hydrogen-bond to each other and to the cables and are secured by parallel crosslinks of hemicellulose.

The primary cell wall may also be made from various other materials such as glycoproteins, waterproofing materials, and [[011/02/Lignin\|lignin]].

The majority of the primary cell wall is made from [[Hydrophilia\|hydrophilic]] substances (pectin and hemicellulose). This allows water to permeate between cells through the primary cell wall. Contrarily, due to the presence of the rigid cellulose microfibrils, the orientation of the microfibrils affects the directional growth and expansion of the plant. This orientation is determined by the [[Cytoskeleton\|cytoskeleton]] within the [[Cellular Membrane\|cell membrane]] of the plant cell.
