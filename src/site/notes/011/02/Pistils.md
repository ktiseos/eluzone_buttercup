A **pistil** is a large structure in the center of the [[011/02/Flowers\|flower]] of an [[011/02/Angiosperms\|angiosperm]] that stores its eggs. The pistil contains at least one [[Ovules\|ovule]]; these ovules store the eggs, and they are protected and maintained by the pistil.

A pistil is made up of one or more [[011/02/Carpels\|carpels]] which have been fused together. The term pistil refers to a “female” structure, and the ovaries and ovules are considered as the “female” flower part or sexual [[011/02/Organs\|organ]] in a plant.
