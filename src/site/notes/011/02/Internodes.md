An **internode** is any region of the [[011/02/Stems\|stem]] or [[Roots\|root]] of a [[011/02/Vascular Plants\|vascular plant]] that is between two [[011/02/Plant Nodes\|nodes]].

In the reproductive regions of an [[011/02/Angiosperms\|angiosperm]], the internodes between the parts of the [[011/02/Flowers\|flower]] [[011/02/Organs\|organ]] are shortened, giving the impression that the [[011/02/Petals\|petals]] and [[011/02/Sepals\|sepals]] have been overlaid or pressed against one another from bud to bloom.
