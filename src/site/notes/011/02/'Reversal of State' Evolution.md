A **“Reversal of State” evolution** is an [[011/02/Evolution\|evolutionary]] development in which an [[Ancestry\|ancestral]] [[011/02/Evolutionary Traits\|trait]] which was not present in the [[011/02/Taxa\|taxon]] at the direct [[011/02/Phylogenetic Node\|node]], but did appear in an earlier ancestral taxon, reappears in a derived taxon.
