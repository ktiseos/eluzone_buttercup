**Cartilage** is a subcategory of [[011/02/Connective Tissues\|connective tissues]]. They are known for being partially flexible, made of [[Collagen\|collagenous]] and sometimes other [[011/02/Proteinaceous Fibers\|proteinaceous fibers]], and a [[Chondrin\|chondrin]] [[011/02/Ground Substance\|ground substance]]. All cartilaginous [[011/02/Tissues\|tissues]] have chondrocyte cells.

Cartilageâ€™s ground substance makes it semi-solid. There are no blood vessels in the tissue; this makes material slow to [[Diffusion\|diffuse]] through, and cartilage slow to heal in turn.

There are multiple types of cartilage, including:
- [[011/02/Elastic Cartilage\|Elastic Cartilage]];
- [[011/02/Fibrocartilage\|Fibrocartilage]];
- and [[011/02/Hyaline Cartilage\|Hyaline Cartilage]].
