A **paraphyletic group** is a [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clade]] which does not include all members within it. It excludes a point of divergence from a [[011/02/Phylogenetic Node\|node]], which may lead to the exclusion of a [[011/02/Taxa\|taxon]] on a [[011/02/Phylogenetic Branch\|branch]] or an entire [[011/02/Monophyletic Groups\|monophyletic]] group.

A paraphyletic group is often the result of incomplete evidence. Historical examples of paraphyletic groups include the exclusion of **[[Aves\|Aves]]**, a modern-day [[Class\|class]] which was previously identified as a major clade under the [[Tetrapods\|tetrapod]] [[Superclass\|superclass]]. Recent evidence shows that members of Aves evolved from the [[Dinosauria\|Dinosauria]] class, who are grouped under the disputed clade [[Reptilia\|Reptilia]]. Previous [[011/02/Phylogenetics\|phylogenies]] of Reptilia as a class are paraphyletic because they exclude classes such as Dinosauria and Aves.
