A **loose connective tissue** is a type of [[011/02/Connective Tissues\|connective tissue]]. It is named for the large space between [[011/02/Tissues\|tissue]] [[Cells\|cells]] which is caused by the dense amount of [[011/02/Ground Substance\|ground substance]] within the [[011/02/Matrix\|matrix]]. The gelatinous matrix greatly divides the cells and “loosely” packs them within the tissue.

Loose connective tissues have [[Fibroblasts\|fibroblast]] cells which secrete the materials used in their matrix. This includes both collagenous and elastic [[011/02/Proteinaceous Fibers\|fibers]] which trail in random directions inside the ground substance. [[011/02/Tissue Macrophages\|Macrophages]] are also often present in loose connective tissues.

Loose connective tissues are used to connect and pack together other tissues inside an [[011/02/Organs\|organ]]. The combination of both collagenous and elastic fibers makes the tissues partially flexible while still retaining their form, aiding in their function to softly pack other tissues.

A loose connective tissue is also referred to as an **areolar connective tissue**. Etymologically, areolar derives from *areola*, a term which historically referred to a “small, open space” such as a courtyard.
