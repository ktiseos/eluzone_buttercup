The **root system** is an [[011/02/Organ Systems\|organ system]] in [[011/02/Vascular Plants\|vascular plants]] that consists of all of the [[Roots\|roots]] which are present in the [[Plants\|plant]]. Two root systems have been observed: [[Fibrous Root System\|fibrous root systems]] and [[011/02/Taproot System\|taproot systems]].

Both fibrous root systems and taproot systems are present across all [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clade]] of vascular plants, with specific exceptions. [[011/02/Gymnosperms\|Gymnosperms]] will almost always possess taproot systems in order to maintain anchorage and support for the plant. [[011/02/Angiosperms\|Angiosperms]] may have either fibrous root or taproot systems, but can be classified as either [[011/02/Monocots\|monocots]] or [[011/02/Eudicots\|eudicots]] based on which they possess; monocots possess fibrous root systems, and eudicots possess taproot systems.
