**Gas embolisms** (simply referred to as **embolisms** in [[Botany\|botany]]) are events in which transport via [[011/02/Water-Conducting Cells\|water-conducting cells]] is blocked due to the presence of an embolus. This embolus is a bubble of air lodged in the [[011/02/Cells\|cells]] which ultimately destroys any cell which it can pass through.
