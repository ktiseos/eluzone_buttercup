**Plastids** are a category of plant cell [[Organelles\|organelles]] which store materials for the [[Plants\|plant]]. All plants possess some form of plastid, and only plants possess them. All plastids are double-membrane organelles; some plastids have three membranes.

Plastids include several kinds of organelles which share [[Developmental Homology\|developmental homologies]]. All of them are developmentally related as they start out as [[Proplastids\|proplastids]], which eventually differentiate into specific plastids; due to this [[011/02/Homology\|homology]], they can also convert into another kind of plastid based on the plant’s needs, even after maturation.

The most well-known organelles are [[011/02/Chloroplasts\|Chloroplasts]]; other plastids include [[011/02/Chromoplasts\|Chromoplasts]], [[011/02/Leukoplasts\|Leukoplasts]], and [[011/02/Amyloplasts\|Amyloplasts]]. Each plastid stores different kinds of nutrients and materials which support the plant’s metabolism and growth.
