A **villus** (*pl.* villi) is a thin, finger-like epithelial projection made from [[011/02/Simple Epithelial Tissues\|simple]] [[011/02/Columnar\|columnar]] [[011/02/Epithelial Tissues\|epithelial tissues]]. It lines several [[Animals\|animal]] [[011/02/Organs\|organs]] such as the [[Small Intestine\|small intestine]], the fetal chorion, and the arachnoid membrane of the [[Humans\|human]] [[Brain\|brain]].

The term villus is derived from a Latin word which refers to a thick tuft of hair that is comparable to fleece.

The villi are an [[011/02/Evolutionary Traits\|evolved trait]] used to extend the [[Surface Area\|surface area]] of the organâ€™s cellular lining. In organs such as the small intestine, the additional surface area is used to increase the space and ability of [[Transport Proteins\|transport proteins]] to [[Absorption\|absorb]] [[Nutrients\|nutrients]] through the intestinal wall. A similar process occurs in the [[011/02/Microvilli\|microvilli]], hence the similar name.
