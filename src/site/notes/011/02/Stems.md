The **stem** is the central stalk of a [[011/02/Vascular Plants\|vascular plant]] that is found in its [[011/02/Shoot System\|shoot system]]. All of the structures in a [[Plants\|plant]] are connected to it; a plant cannot grow and develop without it.

The stem is used for a variety of functions. [[011/02/Meristems\|Meristems]] , initially the [[011/02/Apical Meristems\|apical meristem]] and later the formed [[011/02/Axillary Buds\|axillary buds]], produce [[011/02/Leaves\|leaves]]; the stem contains [[Vascular Tissue\|vascular tissue]] that connects through the [[011/02/Petiole\|petioles]] and leaf [[Veins\|veins]] and transports water and nutrients to the leaves or sugar out of them. The stem also connects the leaves to the [[Roots\|roots]] of the plant.

Stems are typically found aboveground, but they may also be found underground. In cases like those, often where other plant [[011/02/Organs\|organs]] are absent, the stem can be modified to adopt their functions as [[Secondary Functions\|secondary]]. Stems may be modified into [[Rhizomes\|rhizomes]] and [[Stolons\|stolons]] for storage or asexual reproduction, [[011/02/Corms\|corms]] for food storage, or swollen [[Tubers\|tubers]] for reproductive propagation.
