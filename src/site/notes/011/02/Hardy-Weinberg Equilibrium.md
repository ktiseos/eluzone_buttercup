The **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium** is a [[011/02/Biology\|biological]] model which states [[011/02/Evolution\|evolution]] is not being observed in a [[011/02/Biological Population\|population]] provided that several assumptive criteria are not violated. In simplified terms, the criteria are as follows, in no particular order:
1. The [[011/02/Biological Population\|population]] must be large, or even infinitely large;
2. [[Random Mating\|Random mating]] in regards to the observed [[011/02/Evolutionary Traits\|trait]] must be occurring;
3. [[Gene Flow\|Gene flow]] must not be occurring;
4. [[Mutation\|Mutation]] must not be occurring;
5. [[Natural Selection\|Natural selection]] must not be occurring on the observed trait.
When a population adheres to all five criteria, it is not undergoing evolution; the population is in equilibrium. However, if even one criterion is violated, then the population is undergoing evolution.

The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium was developed and presented by G.H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg; the model is accordingly named after both. It is a mathematical model that uses the genetic data of a population in order to determine whether it is in equilibrium or undergoing evolution with regard to a particular trait. Thus, in order to test a population against the model, one must have some prior information about the genetic structure of the population, with a minimum knowledge of either the allelic frequencies or the genotypic frequencies.
