The **protonephridium** is an [[011/02/Organs\|organ]] found in the [[Excretory System\|excretory system]] of several [[Invertebrates\|invertebrates]] such as those in [[Phyla\|phylum]] [[011/02/Platyhelminthes\|Platyhelminthes]]. Thousands of protonephridium compose a network of protonephridia, which is commonly used to refer to the complete network. These networks are found on the body walls of the invertebrate. Each protonephridia is made of a [[Blind-Ended\|blind-ended]] [[Tubules\|tubule]] with a [[Flame Bulb\|flame bulb]] which caps the end of the branch.

The flame bulbs in the protonephridia generate currents which draw [[011/02/Protonephridia\|interstitial fluids]] into the protonephridia tubules. A [[Filtrates\|filtrate]] [[Solutions\|solution]] made from metabolic nitrogenous waste is pulled from the fluids and processed as urine, which exits through the excretory canals and pores.

Protonephridia are comparable to the [[Kidneys\|kidney]] organs found in [[Vertebrates\|vertebrate]] [[Animals\|animals]]. Accordingly, both the protonephridium (and the overarching category [[Nephridia\|nephridia]]) and the [[011/02/Nephrons\|nephron]], the basic cellular unit of the kidneys, use the prefix *nephr-*, which derives from the Greek word for kidney, *nephros*.
