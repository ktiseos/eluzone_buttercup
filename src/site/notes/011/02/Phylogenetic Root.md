A phylogenetic **root** is a point on a [[011/02/Phylogenetics\|phylogeny]] which depicts the oldest [[011/02/Taxa\|taxon]] present on the tree. Notably, while this taxon is old, it must also be the **most recent [[Common Ancestor\|common ancestor]]** (MRCA) of the taxa or [[Clades\|clades]] which [[011/02/Evolution\|evolved]] and appear on later [[011/02/Plant Nodes\|nodes]] of the tree.
