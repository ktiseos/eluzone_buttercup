An **ecosystem** is a categorical level of organization on the macroscopic level inclusive of [[011/02/Biology\|biological]] [[011/02/Organism\|organisms]]. One ecosystem explores a single area or environment, and it is inclusive of both the environment and resources available in that environment as well as the [[011/02/Biological Community\|community]] of organisms present in the ecosystem. As a result, an ecosystem is made of both living and non-living components, and it is the only structural level of life which includes them.
