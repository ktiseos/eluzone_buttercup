**Lateral meristems** are [[011/02/Meristems\|meristem]] groups found on the sides of the [[011/02/Root System\|root]] and [[011/02/Shoot System\|shoot systems]] of [[011/02/Vascular Plants\|vascular plants]]. They form ring-like strips around the [[011/02/Stems\|stem]], [[Branches\|branches]], and [[Roots\|roots]].

Lateral meristems facilitate the growth of [[Secondary Tissues\|secondary tissue]] in [[Plants\|plants]]. This development widens the plant in a lateral or horizontal motion, hence their name. Unlike [[011/02/Apical Meristems\|apical meristems]], lateral meristems are optional for the development of plants; however, all [[011/02/Woody Plants\|woody plants]] have lateral meristems, as they are essential in the development of secondary [[011/02/Tissues\|tissues]] like [[Cork\|cork]] and [[Wood\|wood]].
