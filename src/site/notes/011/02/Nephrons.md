A **nephron** is the primary [[011/02/Cells\|cellular]] unit of the [[Kidneys\|kidneys]] which is developed from [[011/02/Epithelial Tissues\|epithelial tissue]]. It is found in rows and rings of [[011/02/Simple Epithelial Tissues\|simple]] [[011/02/Cuboidal\|cuboidal]] epithelial tissue. A single unit takes the form of an oval microscopic [[Tubules\|tubule]] with a [[Lumen\|lumen]] and is surrounded by blood vessels, while the full unit of nephrons is surrounded by the [[Basement Membrane\|basement membrane]].

Nephrons perform the primary functions of the kidney: filtering [[Solutes\|solute]] intake, processing [[Urine\|urine]], and maintaining the [[Homeostasis\|homeostasis]] and [[Osmolarity\|osmolarity]] of the [[Blood\|blood]].
