A **proteinaceous fiber** is a long, thin strand present in the [[011/02/Matrix\|matrix]] of a [[011/02/Connective Tissues\|connective tissue]]. The fiber is made of at least one [[Proteins\|protein]] and possesses a string-like arrangement; it is submerged in the [[011/02/Ground Substance\|ground substance]] to prevent it from separating from the [[011/02/Tissues\|tissue]].

Proteinaceous fibers can be made of many proteins. The most common fibers are collagenous and/or elastic; accordingly, they are made of [[Collagen\|collagen]] and/or [[Elastin\|elastin]], resulting in their descriptors.
