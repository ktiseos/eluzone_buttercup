The **“Date of Creation”** was a date proposed by James Usher, a Western Christian bishop, around 1694. The Date of Creation was proposed as October 22, 4004 B.C.E. It was claimed that on this date, all of creation was “brought into existence”, including all [[Species\|species]] and organisms, and reinforced the idea of a permanent, perfect form.

The “Date of Creation,” if it were true today, would imply two major points which deviate from scientific thought. Chiefly, it would state the Earth is only approximately 6000 years old. Secondly, it would imply all species have no relation to one another as is suggested via [[011/02/Modern Evolutionary Theory\|evolution]] and [[011/02/Phylogenetics\|phylogenetics]] and were brought into existence independent of one another.
