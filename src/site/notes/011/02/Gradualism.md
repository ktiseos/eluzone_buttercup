**Gradualism** was a principle proposed by James Hutton around 1795. Gradualism proposed that large geological change was the product of slow, continuous, and cumulative natural processes.

This principle explains the erosion of a plain into a valley or canyon, such as the Grand Canyon and the resultant Colorado River, whose separation spanned across lifetimes.
