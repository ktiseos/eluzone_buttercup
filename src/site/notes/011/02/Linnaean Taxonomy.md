The **Linnaean taxonomical system** is a [[011/02/Systematics\|systematic]] classification of [[011/02/Organism\|organisms]] into nested, [[Hierarchies\|hierarchal]] ranks that was invented by [[Carolus Linnaeus\|Carolus Linnaeus]]. This system has pervaded into modern day and expanded since Linnaeusâ€™s time.

The modern zoological ranks of Linnaean taxonomy, from broadest to most specific, are as follows, with the major ranks being numbered and minor ranks being bulleted:
1. [[Domains\|Domains]];
2. [[Kingdoms\|Kingdoms]];
3. [[Phyla\|Phyla]];
4. [[Classes\|Classes]];
5. [[Orders\|Orders]];
6. [[Families\|Families]];
	- Superfamilies;
	- Subfamilies;
	- Tribes;
	- Subtribes;
7. [[Genera\|Genera]];
	- Subgenera;
8. [[Species\|Species]].
	- Subspecies.

In the Linnaean taxonomical system, ranks between domains and families are always capitalized, but not italicized. Ranks involving genera and species are italicized or underlined; see the connected system of [[011/02/Binomial Nomenclature\|binomial nomenclature]] for more information.
