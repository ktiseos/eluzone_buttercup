**Phylogenetics** is the study of the [[011/02/Evolution\|evolutionary]] history of [[move later/Biology\|biology]] via phylogenies (*sg.* phylogeny), [[011/02/Taxonomy\|taxonomic]] trees which prioritize placing [[011/02/Taxa\|taxa]] into complete [[011/02/Taxonomic Clades\|clades]]. Examples of full phylogenies include the “Tree of Life,” where all modern [[move later/Organism\|organisms]] ([[Bacteria\|Bacteria]], [[Archaea\|Archaea]], [[Animalia\|Animalia]], etc.) are linked to a [[Common Ancestor\|common ancestor]] ([[LUCA\|“LUCA”]]), or a [[Chordata\|Chordata]] phylogeny for all [[Vertebrates\|vertebrate]] organisms.

Phylogenetics emphasizes **completeness, accuracy, and simplified reasoning** to examine the evolutionary history of all studied organisms. Phylogenetics prioritizes the study of [[011/02/Monophyletic Groups\|monophyletic groups]] and the [[011/02/Principle of Parsimony\|Principle of Parsimony]] and of [[Principle of Maximum Likelihood\|Maximum Likelihood]]. A complete, accurate phylogeny can depict [[011/02/Sister Groups\|sister groups]] and identify or assume genetic similarities between taxa.

One should note here that while a phylogeny can do many things, it still has several specific limits.
1. A phylogeny is only able to show lineage and ancestry; it does not show the **[[Phenotypes\|phenotypic]] similarity** or the chance of similarity between taxa. Refer to pages on [[Morphology\|morphology]], [[011/02/Homology\|homology]], and [[Analogy\|analogy]].
2. By default, a phylogeny is only able to show that ancestry and branching was present; it does not show when these events occurred, how long ago they occurred, or how much time transpired between these events unless it is attached to dates and times.
	- Additionally, a phylogeny does not show the time transpired between nodes to scale unless it comes with a relative scale for branch lengths.
3. no assumption of evolution of a species from its sister taxon/taxa

> [!quote] “This is a good place to reiterate that any phylogenetic tree represents a hypothesis about how the organisms in the tree are related to one another. […] Thinking of phylogenies as hypotheses also allows us to use them in a powerful way: We can make and test predictions based on the assumption that a particular phylogeny—our hypothesis—is correct.”

A basic phylogeny is depicted similarly to a flow chart. The tree begins with a [[011/02/Phylogenetic Root\|root]] which extends towards [[011/02/Phylogenetic Node\|nodes]] later on the diagram. These points are connected via [[011/02/Phylogenetic Branch\|branches]] which show the inheritance of evolutionary [[011/02/Evolutionary Traits\|traits]] between distinct taxa, with hatch marks that denote specific evolutionary characters.
