**Compound leaves** are [[011/02/Leaves\|Leaves]] whose [[011/02/Leaf Blade\|blade]] is subdivided into several small [[Leaflets\|leaflets]]. An entire group of leaflets connected to the same [[011/02/Petiole\|petiole]] is considered as a single compound leaf. Leaflets and their “stems”, actually petioles, have different properties than the full leaves connected to [[011/02/Stems\|stems]]. They do not have [[011/02/Plant Nodes\|nodes]] and [[011/02/Internodes\|internodes]]; [[011/02/Apical Buds\|terminal buds]] cannot grow at the tip of the petiole; there are no [[011/02/Axils\|axils]] in the petioles; and [[011/02/Axillary Buds\|axillary buds]] do not grow at the bases of the leaflets.

Compound leaves are typically flattened, as if they have been ironed.
