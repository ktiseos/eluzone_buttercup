A **tissue** is a categorical level of organization on the cellular level within biological organisms. A tissue is a grouping of [[Cells\|cells]] who chiefly possess similar embryonic developmental origins as well as similar functions. A grouping of these tissues is then known as an [[011/02/Organs\|organ]].

There are over 200 distinct animal tissues with separate origin and function, such as adipose tissues, [[011/02/Cartilage\|cartilage]], and spinal tissues. However, they can be generally categorized into four types: [[011/02/Epithelial Tissues\|epithelial]], [[011/02/Connective Tissues\|connective]], [[Muscle\|muscle]], and [[Nervous\|nervous]] tissues.

Biological tissues are studied via a branch of microbiology known as [[011/02/Histology\|histology]].
