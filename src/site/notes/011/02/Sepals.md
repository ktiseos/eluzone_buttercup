A **sepal** is a [[011/02/Leaves\|leaf]] or [[011/02/Petals\|petal]]-like blade in the [[011/02/Flowers\|flower]] of a [[011/02/Vascular Plants\|vascular plant]] that encloses the petals and the remainder of the flower while it is budding. The sepals are the lowest parts of the flower [[011/02/Organs\|organ]]; when the flower blooms, the sepals unfurl and flatten out beneath the rest of the flower.

Sepals are modified from leaves. They protect the [[011/02/Apical Buds\|terminal bud]] and the [[011/02/Apical Meristems\|apical meristem]] inside while [[Sexual Reproduction\|sexually reproductive]] organs develop in the bud.
