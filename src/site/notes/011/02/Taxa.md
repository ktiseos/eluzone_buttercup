**Taxa** (*sg.* taxon) are categorical units with identifiable names. A taxon can identify any named group regardless of organizational level. It may be **[[Extant\|extant]]**, meaning it is still alive and surviving (ex-*sto*, meaning to stand,) or **[[Extinction\|extinct]]** (ex-*stinguere*). Taxa are used in [[011/02/Taxonomy\|taxonomy]] to classify and organize organisms and ranks of organisms by common names or traits.
