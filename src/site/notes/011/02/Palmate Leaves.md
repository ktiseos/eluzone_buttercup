A **palmate leaf** is any [[011/02/Compound Leaves\|compound leaf]] where the [[Leaflets\|leaflets]] attach onto a single point, the terminal, of the [[011/02/Petiole\|petiole]]. The [[011/02/Whorled Leaves\|whorled]] attachment gives the [[011/02/Leaves\|leaves]] a “palm”-like shape, referring to the stretched palm of a hand. This phenomenon of palmate arrangement is known as **palmation**.
