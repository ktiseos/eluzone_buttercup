**Fibrocartilage** is a type of [[011/02/Cartilage\|cartilaginous]] [[011/02/Tissues\|tissue]] in the [[011/02/Connective Tissues\|connective tissue]] category. It is known for being a sturdier form of cartilage due to the presence of many bundles of [[Collagen\|collagenous]] [[011/02/Proteinaceous Fibers\|fibers]] within the [[Chondrin\|chondrin]] [[011/02/Matrix\|matrix]]. The collagenous fibers are densely packed between the [[Lacunae\|lacunae]] openings. This strengthens the tissue and makes it able to withstand higher pressures than other types of cartilage.

Fibrocartilage has chondrocytes which occupy the lacunae. Like other forms of cartilage, the density, semi-solid nature of the chondrin, and the lack of blood vessels present in the cartilage makes fibrocartilage hard for materials to pass through to repair it.

Fibrocartilage can be found supporting organs which handle high pressure, but may be easier to sprain, such as the vertebrae disks of the spinal column.

Fibrocartilageâ€™s name is derived from the bundles of fiber found in the matrix (hence the prefix *fibro-*, referring to fiber or the state of being fibrous.)
