An **organ system** is a grouping of similar [[011/02/Organs\|organs]]. It is the penultimate categorical level which denotes the structure of [[move later/Cells\|cells]] in a biological [[Organisms\|organism]], and when present, it precedes the [[move later/Organism\|organismal]] level itself.

Not all organisms possess organ systems, such as Spongifera, fungi, and prokaryotes; however, any entity that possesses organ systems can be defined as an organism.
