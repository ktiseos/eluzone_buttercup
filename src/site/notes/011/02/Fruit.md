A botanical **fruit** is any fleshy structure developed by an [[011/02/Angiosperms\|angiosperm]] from the [[011/02/Flowers\|flower]] ovary. The ovary contains an ovule egg which has been fertilized by sperm from a [[Pollen Grains\|pollen grain]]; this egg developed into a seed and is now enclosed by the fruit. The fruit acts as protection for the seed while developing; later, the structure aids in the propagation of the seeds as it separates from the mother plant.

Many common fruits are aromatic and edible, but not all fruit is. Ginkgoceae, a phylum of gymnosperms, produces a fruit-like envelope that contains the malodorous butanoic acid. Pistachio fruit is often discarded for commercial consumption.
