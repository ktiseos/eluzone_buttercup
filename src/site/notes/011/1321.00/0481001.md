# Key Definitions in Music
## Textures
- Textures define how melody and harmony are interwoven
Music primarily utilizes monophonic, homophonic, and polyphonic textures:
- **Monophony:** One single “voice” forming a melody, without pitches and variations added to the melody.
- **Homophony:** A main melody accompanied by played or sung variations, creating a harmony:
	- The melody is the “part you remember”; homophony is added with additional chords (think of a Mozart piece).
- **Polyphony:** Various melodies occurring at the same time; a melody and a countermelody.
	- ie the same lyrics staggered over time ( “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” ) or two independent melodies (Bach)
	- Often uses **imitation** (restatements of a melody)
Other variations:
- **Heterophony:** Variations of the same melody;
- **Homorhythm:** When all melody and harmony moves with the same rhythmic pattern; the melody and harmony are different, but move on the same timing.
## Basic Definitions for Melody
- **Pitch:** The high or low attribute of a sound.
- **Melody:** A line or tune in music comprised of different pitches with differing intervals.
- **Intervals:** The distance between two notes.
- **Range:** How many different notes are present in the melody, or the traveling distance between the pitches of the notes; wide or narrow range of notes
- **phrase** — a line of the melody (a line in the **stanza**)
## melody
- **conjunct** — the intervals of the melody are close together, making it easy to sing and play
	- “Mary Had a Little Lamb”
- **disjunct** — the intervals of the melody are further apart and make it slightly more difficult to sing/play
	- “Star-Spangled Banner”
- melodies have different **shapes**; drawn with **contours** on sheets
	- **wave-like** — conjunct, narrow variations
		- “Ode to Joy”
		- may remain wave-like even when disjunct
	- **descending** — wider range, but may still be conjunct
		- “Joy to the World”
	- melodic motion
- **cadence** — a resting point in the music, such as at the end of a phrase
- **countermelody** — a melody that exists independent and against another melody

- ancient greeks emphasized vocals – ethos
- christians – worry of sensuality
- greek healing properties to body and mind; divine

- well-educated and upper class people necessary to have musical education
## ancient greek music
- monophonic
- sometimes embellished/punctuated with but not enhanced by instruments
- improvised (no system of written notation) based on prevailing style of the day
- melody and rhythm linked to ancient greek poetry
- words were considered the most important thing, and singing was constructed around it

- Pythagoras: music and numbers intertwined
	- rhythm and poetic meter interlinked
	- broke music down into ratio: intervals such as the octave (the same note eight notes apart, with one higher than the other; 2:1), the fifth (3:2), the fourth (4:3)
	- scales organized on these ideas: tetracords
- Aristoxenus, Cleonides theories
- tetracord: a four note section of a scale (seven notes or eight notes that end on the same pitch)
	- ancient: descending order scales
	- modern: ascending order

		- crude, but origin of notation system
# medieval music
## sacred music
- gregorian chant
	- sacred style of singing used in medieval era
	- wide reaching
	- first style of notated written music; notation was devised for gregorian
	- text and performance of melody shaped by its use in the liturgy
- church calendar: organized by feast days, commendation, saint days, or days of christ
	- office and mass services celebrate calendar rituals
	- office: celebrated through the day, such as psalms, antiphons, lessons w/ responsories, hymns, prayers
	- mass: most important service; prayers, bible readings, psalm singing
- two parts of mass: proper and ordinary
	- proper changes from day-to-day; different calendar days
	- ordinary is constant for each mass; said thee same way each time
- mass was instructional and inspirational for illiterate
	- only people educated were people of the church: parishioners, priests, etc.

- three main manners of singing chant
	- responsorial: call and response
	- antiphonal: alteration between groups
	- direct: single group
- three different styles of text settings
	- syllabic: one note per syllable
	- melismatic: several notes per syllable
		- melisma: decoration
	- pneumatic: partial melismatic, partial syllabic
- chant melodies reflect word inflection and rhythm
	- matches divisions in text/word
	- arch-like phrases; matches the natural inflection of speaking
		- rising, sustaining, falling
- simplest chants are recitation formulas: recite for recitation prayers and bible readings
- psalm tone: formula for singing psalms in the office
	- eight scales used in medieval times
	- one tone for each scale
	- tonus peligrinus: transitory tone that goes beyond the eight tones; “wandering tone”
- monks and nuns sang in two different groups for antiphonal
	- cantor sings both antiphon and psalm
- hymns usually strophic: one section repeats again
	- sung by office choir for each service
- office responsories: gradual, alleluia, offertory are all sung responsorily

## polyphony
- recorded polyphony: “old style” not attributed to any composer
- oral improvitory practice
- **organum:**
	- **droning:** use of a drone; final pitch is held by an instrument and/or voice of a group
	- **parallel organum:** original plainchant has one voice, while another voice sings fifth below in parallel motion
	- **mixed/oblique organum:** combination of droning/parallel: one sings plainchant, other voice alternates between droning and parallel organum
	- **free organum:** one voice sings plainchant, other sings variety of droning, parallel, and similar motions
- **discant and florid organum:** sing same melody at different rates
- **notre dame polyphony:** taught at notre dame

# renaissance music
- Printing Press
	- gutenburg
	- 15th century
	- adaptable type was adapted to music notation, increasing popularity and accessibility
- organum developed need for notation; rhythmic modes and patterns were foundation
- development of meter: mensuration
- Josquin de Prez — most important of time
- 1450-1500
- Franco-Flemish composers
	- Ockhegem
## Ockhegem
- French composer
- French royal court
- took accepted vocalist range and expanded it **downward**
	- lower singers sang lower, creating rich texture and opportunity
	- “expanded base downward”
- polyphonic, but full and uncomplicated music
	- easy to listen to
## Josquin de Prez
- music was largely published by Petrucci
- longterm trending
- imitation
- all voices had equal importance in the music
	- importance was placed on each line rather than one line taking precedence
- like Machaut, wrote sacred and secular work
## Odhekaton
- Petrucci published a lot of music; one of the most important, even if not first, volume, was the Odhekaton
- Odhekaton: polyphonic chanson volume
	- three-four voice chansons by Josquin, Ochekgem, Isaac, etc.
- more anthologies followed
	- shows development of voices (3 to 4) and richness, equality, texture (increased imitation and equality between voices)
	- imitation was the style of the time; polyphony was found across several generations
		- Ave Maria, sacred Josquin
## Masses
- **tenor mass:** built on a single cantus firmus used as a basis for each section of the song
- **cantus firmus mass:** Gregorian chant is used only in the tenor voice
- **paraphrase  mass:** Gregorian chant is layered across all voices, and voices are based on the pre-existing melody
- **parody mass:** an imitative mass whose voices are borrowed from a pre-existing polyphonic work
- naming masses based on mode/scale, the presence of a canon
	- missa sin nomine: no cantus firmus or structural features
	- **canon:** a structural element; “rule”; a unifying device for compositional masses in the 15th  century
		- two or more voices derived from a single voice; two or more melodies derived from a single melody
		- several rules associated with use of canon
			- augmentation, diminishing
