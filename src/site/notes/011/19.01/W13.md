# queer social networking
- enhanced by the Internet and its increase in population/popularity since the mid-1990s
- “the idea that the internet provides interaction and information on a global scale and in an unequivocally egalitarian way is problematic; it does not consider issues such as nationality, social class, and general access to resources—reliable electricity, for instance—needed to use the internet. It also does not account for the fact that some governments prohibit access to specific sites and information or for the fact that, in the United States, access can be limited for people whose primary internet usage occurs in schools or libraries.”
	- “For those with access, the internet, with its multiple venues for textually complex and visually rich expression, offers LGBTQ people some opportunity to articulate their concerns, interests, and desires. Given the highly interactive nature of the internet, users can not only represent themselves but also exchange ideas, form a variety of communities, and meet others from around the world.”
