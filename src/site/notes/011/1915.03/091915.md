## history of medicine and lgbtq+ people
- 1800s: pathologization of homosexuality
	- 1869, Karl-Marie Kertbeny: homosexual definition irt anti-sodomy laws, then carried over into medical health by Kraffft-Ebing
	- late 1800s: bisexual co-opted to reference peoples’ sexual orientation as well as(?) hermaphroditic plants in botany
- early 1900s: intersex co-opted from biology; was synonymous with homosexual
	- continued pathologization of queerness; “heterosexual-homosexual rating scale” adopted and applied to individuals’ sexual behavior and psychic reactions (thoughts, feelings, fantasies)
	- 1960s, gay rights movement: distrust of medical establishment, rejection of most health care providers and attempts to find affirming providers
	- early 1950s: medical transition of Christine Jorgensen (woman of the year awd; celebrity)
	- late 1960s/early 1970s: homegrown self-help books, including with content on alcohol safety, STIs, and prohibited vulnerable health topics (*Our Bodies, Ourselves* and other works published by feminists in a major movemeent)
	- 1965: first study of gender-affirming/sex reassignment surgery → Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore
		- ended in 1978 due to transphobic research and resumed recently in modernity
	- 1981-: AIDS epidemic reports and increased stigmatization of gay men and queer communities
		- healthcare and advocation via metropolitan grassroots organizations: NY Gay Men’ss Health Crisis, Tidewater AIDS Crisis Taskforce, AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power
	- 21st century medical awareness
		- widespread attempts to obtain gender-affirming surgery, esp. w/ health insurance vs. out-of-pocket
## medical theory
- early theories (1800s) viewed sexual variance as pathological
	1. **homosexuality as innate theory**
		- innate sexuality co-opted from Greco-Roman belief; third sex, social tolerance
	2. **degeneracy theory**
		- homosexuality and bisexuality comparable to criminality, alcoholism, and drug addition
		- deviance resulted from the modern exhaustion of the gene pool via life, vice, and indulgence
	3. **Darwinian theory**
		- non-stem dogwhistle incoming
			- “me when i hear about darwin in biology and evolution: YEAHHHH LETS GO / me when i hear darwin anywhere else:”
		- homosexuality and bisexuality were reversal-of-state evolutions and primitive
			- yeah there it is
	4. **psychoanalytic theory**
		- Freudian postulations
			- infantile perversion
			- pleasure was shaped by society into “productive heterosexuality”, but trauma and conflict caused regression
			- homosexuality was psychosexual immaturity, not a disease
			- talk therapy
	5. **behaviorism**
		- “learned behavior” of sexual orientation
		- reward and punishment psychology (operant conditioning), gay conversion therapy
- modern institutionalized views of LGBTQ+ health view it under four lenses:
	- **minority stress model**
		- marginalization and minority identity produces personal and group stress that induces psychological and physiological effects
		- distal vs. proximal: external victimization vs. concealment and internal psychology
	- **life-course perspective**
	- **intersectionality perspective**
		- intersectionality for LGBTQ+ identifying individuals
		- considering all demographics in health issues, a holistic identity
	- **social ecology**
