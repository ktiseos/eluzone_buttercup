- legal history (in the U.S.) with regard to local/state/national government

> our system of constitutional law is premised on the rights enumerated in the federal constitution being natural rights—that is, rights that are inalienable and preexist our government. What this means is that the [Bill of Rights](https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/introlgbtqstudies/chapter/lgbtq-legal-history/#term_820_543), the first ten amendments to the Constitution, does not grant any rights. Rather, each amendment represents a mandate for the government to not interfere with individual rights or to not prevent others from doing so.
