- 1970–1990
- “Red Power”
- The “state of nature” is paid for by the state of man. It’s a uniquely American arrangement: When the colonists first came to America, the land they claimed—and what grew on it—was considered the property of the king of England. But here in northern Minnesota, for now, public land still benefits the people.
# 1940s–: Civil Rights Movement
- Civil Rights Movement encapsulating Native Americans
- 1944: 50-tribe delegates formed National Congress of American Indians (NCAI)
	- address termination, poor feederal policy, strengthen intertribal relations
	- high percent of women delegates
	- equal rights and equal protection, restoration of treaty rights, land and culture reclamation
	- overturned federal job disscrimination, state law reservation bans, limited state judicial control, health care, employment, education
	- gradualist, steady work: policy against direct action
		- conservative members purged in 1960s
		- 1964: Vine Deloria Jr. → exec. director
- 1950s: National Indian Youth Council (NIYC)
	- Clyde Warrior, Ponca
		- also the 1960 Southwest Regional Indian Youth Council president
		- *being Indian was good, and what culture and tradition Indians maintained were good as well, and sufficient to the task of being Indian in the twentieth century and beyond. It doesn’t sound so radical in our age of identity politics, but it was radical then, especially among Indians. Hundreds of years of being missionized, colonized, reservationized, mainstreamed, marginalized, and criminalized had had a pernicious effect on Indian self-regard. How not to think of oneself as less, how not to think of oneself and one’s place as at the bottom of hierarchical America after being downtrodden for a century?*
	- youth leadership and firebrand, active, invested movements for Indian rights
	- Browning Pipestem
	- “take the negtive image of the Indians and shove it down people’s throats”
	- 1966: NIYC direct action in PNW over treaty and fishing rights; “fish-ins” with intertribal alliances and allyship; primary pursuance of tribal sovereignty and Indian culture
# American Indian Movement
- 1970s: inspiration and following of Black Panthers as a model for resistance
	- not only civil rights, but economic and political power and disruption of imperialism
- American Indian Movement (AIM) led by Dennis Banks, Clyde and Vernon Bellecourt, George Mitchell, Harold Powless
- economic independence and freedom from police ebrutality
- loud, visible militant theatrics
	- forcing women and lighter-skinned Indians out of image; “The leaders were obsessed with image and given to grandstanding. Yet in the midst of the counterculture movement that co-opted so much Indian aesthetic and culture, AIM was doing one thing right: it was showing Indians around the country that they were proud of being Indian, and in the most uncomfortable ways possible for the mainstream. Indians from reservations and cities alike were, for the first time, pushing back against the acculturation machine that was a part of America’s domestic imperial agenda, and doing it loud and proud.”
