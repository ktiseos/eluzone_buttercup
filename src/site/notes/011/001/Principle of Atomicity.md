The Principle of Atomicity is a guiding mindset for [[011/001/Zettelkasten\|Zettelk√§sten]] archivists. It states that one note should correspond to one idea; it emphasizes brevity and singularity within a larger whole. It is, after all, coined after the scientific [[Atomic Unit\|atom]] unit, the smallest of its kind.
