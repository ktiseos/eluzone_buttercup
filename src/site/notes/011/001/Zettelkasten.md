The **Zettelkasten** (*trans-lit.* slip box, from German; *pl.* Zettelkästen) method is a method of information preservation derived from the method of the same name described and used by scientist [[Niklas Luhmann\|Niklas Luhmann]] in the 20th century. It is primarily known as a note-taking method, based on the name and iconic usage through paper notecards, but it may be used as an organic and free-structure method of thought.

A Zettelkasten collection possesses three key features: ([src.](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#a-zettelkasten-is-a-personal-tool-for-thinking-and-writing))
1. **It is [[011/001/Hypertextuality\|hypertextual]].**
2. **It adheres to the *[[011/001/Principle of Atomicity\|Principle of Atomicity]]*.**
3. **It is personal.**

With this method, the Zettelkasten can provide a path of thought through a given topic or multiple. This line of thinking can be used to connect and consider aspects of the world at large. It is high-effort because its archivist’s time is chiefly spent managing and improving it; but, the effort is highly rewarding. One only needs look at Luhmann’s [[Niklas Luhmann#aa\|accolades]] to prove this.

One further note on the Zettelkasten at large: its content is **unfiltered**. It is described as a “[septic tank](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-hubs/)” or a digestive tract; pruning and editing comes second.

A Zettelkasten note collection can be divided into several [[Hierarchies\|hierarchical]] categories:
1. The **[[011/001/Fleeting Notes\|fleeting notes]]**, stream-of-conscious, but short.
2. The **[[011/001/Literature Notes\|literature notes]]**, wholly unfiltered, longform notes which rely on source material.
4. The **[[Hub Notes\|hub notes]]** which help group notes together.
5. The **[[011/001/Permanent Notes\|permanent notes]]**, the culmination of the Zettelkasten.

Or, in a succinct hierarchical structure:

1. The **raw data**, the bread-and-butter;
2. The **interpretation** of data;
3. The **full organization and synthesis** which formally combines both underlying rungs.

One should realize that the use of the term *hierarchy* does not suggest fleeting notes are less important than permanent notes; rather, it is used to highlight a [[stepwise\|stepwise]] process. Although the culmination is the permanent note, it is a *synthetic* culmination; all other notes are of equal importance.
