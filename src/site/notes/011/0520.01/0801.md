*Talk the Language of the Larger World: Fishing Wars, Natural Resources, and the Birth of the Sovereignty Movement in the Postwar Pacific Northwest*

> “If we're going to say we're nations and we got sovereignty and our treaties are as valid as other treaties, then we got to talk the language of the larger world.”
- 03/02/1964: NIYC “fish-in”
	- Marlon Brando
	- treaty fishermen violating fishing laws and disputing dubious legality
	- fishing wars of 1960s–1970s
	- industrial development postwar vs. natural resource economies
# context
- early 1960s: change natural resource management for long-term sustainability
	- Native communities paid a higher price for management:  priorrelocation and termination, rights restriction
		- OG and WN: fear annual fish harvest threatened fish returns; small percent compared to reservations for sport and commercial
- 1855 treaties: right to fish at “usual and accustomed places”
	- 1955–1970s dispute and interpretation over treaty
	- “the debate around the treaties of 1855 was not simply a legal one; it also showcased the systemic legacies of colonialism and its impact on Native American communities. As historian Alvin Josephy remarked, "\[T]he issue of Indian treaty fishing rights has often been attended more by emotion and racist prejudice than by understanding.”
- Columbia River and Puget Sound
	- political, social, and economic dimensions shaped through fishing wars and resistance; Indian sovereignty
- limits of timber industry in PNW → sustained-yield practice and hydroelectric dams to support industry
	- 44 dams in 1975: few salmon passages
- 1963 9 nuclear reactors w/ Hanford
	- national energy powerhouse
- mid-1960s: reduction of Pacific salmon, extinction (2.1 to 1.1 in 1947–1960; 22mil to 5 pounds (fluctuating))
	- proportional to the poverty and economic rate of Native communities
- treaties succeeded due to provision of right to fish
	- 1887, *United States v. Taylor*; Yakama
	- 1889, Washington net fishing abolishment attempt
	- 1905, *United States v. Winans*: illegal to obstruct native waterways
	- 1919, *Seufert Brothers v. United States*, delimiting vs. regional fish canneries
- special rights claimed to conflict with citizenship
	- 1946: Indian nation vs. citizenship; “dual identity” undermining
	- specific language/pedantry
	- 1960–1970s: fishing site dispute
- The Dalles Dam and “in-lieu” on the Columbia River (Bonneville Dam consequence)
	- 1950s regulation of in-lieu sites
	- inundation led to lower salmon runs; divisioninto zones
		- racist bordering of commercial zones
		- Indian zone reserved for subsistence and ceremony, not conservation
- termination policy and assimilationism
	- 1953 Public Law 280: civil and criminal jurisdiction over reservation transferred to state, allowing vague revision to treaty rights
# fishing wars
- 1964 “fish-ins”
	- NIYC, but not CRM; “matter of identity and goals”
		- unique legal relationship, uphold; vs. crm: problematic racial relationship and reverse
		- minority rights vs. treaty rights
		- cultural separatism vs. assimilationism
	- activism began earlier in PNW (mid-1960s instead of late) with roots in treaty rights and natural resources
- mid-1960s: “salmon war” and “fishing war”
	- militant confrontations
	- local, state, federal court disputes
	- Puget Sound and Columbia River
		- areas with treaty rights threatened via state agencies and commercial fishing
		- unique circumstances to each relevant to jurisdiction and PL280
## Puget Sound
- under WN, original state in PL280
- first fishing wars: Puyallup River 1954, Robert Satiacum, possession of steelhead
	- 1957: *Washington State v. Satiacum*
	- 20 year legal ambiguity: guaranteed right to fish, but observations aand arrests varied
- 1963: considering amending or purchasing treaty rights
	- maintaining regulation of natural resources; unequal shares, privilege
- mid-1960s: “natural resource *conservation*” vs. regulation
	- conflict of “the greater good” conflicting with conservation rates of tribes: 6.5% tribal fishing vs 93.5 commercial and sport
## Columbia River
- WN/Oregon; 1950s varied determinations between states
- in-lieu fishing site residence; disagreement with Oregon
- 1965: David Sohappy, Cooks’s Landing
- 1966: 32+ arrests at Cook’ss; releaed after interpreting and citing the treaty rightsto dismiss charges
- annual fish harvest claimed to conflict with greater good; injuring commercial fish economy
	- identical rates to Puget Sound
## Shared
- 1967 tensions: vague commercial fishing season dates
	- fishing season established by tribes, state, and individual fishermen
- intervention to further fishing rights cases
- BIA silence and absence until 1968
	- self-determination after *Puyallup*: defensee of Indians
- 1969: favor in *Sohappy v. Smith* + *United States v. Oregon*
	- rewrite fishing laws for treaty harvest
	- Belloni: “affected much more by the superior political power of sport and commercial fishermen over a handful of Indians rather than on reason and fairness”
	- no allocation amount granted; temporary relief, but specifics prevent conceding and decisions
	- many did not follow provisions
- 1968: ICRA and preessure to direct BIA: “Special Message on Indian Affairs”
	- self-determination for Natives
	- coincided with 1974: *United States v. State of Wahington*
	- 3/22/1974: Boldt decision: carry out in accordance with meaning understood by tribes
	- established specifics; landmark in federal Indian policy
	- attempts to appeal failed; no arrests aand upport by BIA on Belloni and Boldt
- postwar growth dissolved by 1973: recession; Fordism
- environmentalism, Greenpeace and EPA (1970): preserve and sustain vs. evelop and exploit; rejection of dams
- self-determination without termination: 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act
- 1976: 25y program for development: American Indian Development Authority for jurisdiction and provision of Native communities
