# Asteraceae
- Sunflower family
- Composite
- Annual to trees
- Variable leaves
- Inflorescent head
## Radiate Heads
- Receptacles
	- Bracts on the receptacle: Phyllaries/Involucre
- Ray and disk flowers
	- Ovary attached to a large receptacle
	- Modified sepal: Pappus
		- Missing if no pappus
	- Bracts around the disk flowers: paleae (sing. palea)
	- Disk flowers are bisexual, male, or sterile
		- Plunger-style
		- Stamens are adnate to corolla
		- 2 style branches push out and hook outside of an antheridial tube
	- Ray flowers are female or sterile
		- Three lobes
		- Made from five fused petals
- Inferior ovary with 2 fused carpels
- Achenes
- Corolla of 5/4 connate petals
- Radiate heads: Ray flowers and disk flowers are present
- Different types of pappus:
	- None (Epappose) or a lot
	- Bristled: Long, pointed, flexible
	- Barbed awns: Inflexible
	- Scales: Flat
	- Plumose: Typically bristles; feathered or fluffy
		- Original bristle has side bristles that make it appear plumose
		- Tufts of bristles
- Sunflowers
## Liguliflorous Heads
- Ligulate flowers only
- Bisexual flowers
- Bilateral
- Ligule strap
- Dandelions
	- *Taraxacum officiale*
- Five lobes
## Discoid Heads
- Many species in *Senecio*
- Only disk flowers
	- Radial and bisexual
### *Senecio* (*Packera*)
- Cyme-like inflorescence clusters
	- Determinate inflorescence
	- End flowers open and buds are near base of stem
- 1 main series of phyllaries
	- 8, 13, or 21 phyllaries in a series
	- may be black-tipped
- Epaleate
- Minute barbed bristle pappus
- Generally yellow flowers
#### *Senecio vulgaris*
- Butterweed, common *Senecio*, common groundsel
- Weed
- Short outer phyllaries
	- Main series is long
- Cobweb hairs/trichomes
- Alternate leaves
	- Lobate
# Poaceae
- Grass family
	- Gramineae
	- Most are herbaceous, non-woody
	- Annuals to perennials
	- Cereal crops: Corn, rice, oats, wheat
- Monocots
	- Fibrous roots
	- Swollen nodes and hollow internodes
- Dominates low-rainfall landscape
- Vegetative
	- Two growth forms
		- Rhizomatous growth form/Sod-forming grasses
			- Lawn-type, spreading
		- Bunch grasses
			- Most native Californian grasses
- Linear leaves with a sheath and a blade
	- Open sheathes are non-fused and wrapping/overlapping around the stem
	- Vs. Fused sheathes which are fused directly to stem
	- Leaves have a ligule between the blade and sheath: Flap of fibrous tissue
		- Ligules are used in grass identification
- Inflorescences may be spike-like or open
	- Florets: A basic unit in inflorescence with a flower and two ranked bracts
		- Lemma is inferior bract, palea is superior to other bract
		- Bracts enclose the flower
		- Lemma possesses awms: fibrous filaments that are terminal are close to the terminal
	- Spikelet: The basic unit of inflorescences; one or more florets with two ranked bracts
		- Bracts are referred to as “glumes”
- Flowers are not showy, wind-pollinated
	- 3 stamens
		- Dangling, hanging out of inflorescence
	- Superior ovary made of 2 fused carpels (connation)
	- Remnants of perianth: Lodicule glands
		- May swell to open the flower
		- Feathery stigmas for catching pollen
## *Avena*
- Oats
- Four species; all non-native
- Annuals
- Ligule is membranous and rounded at top; 2-5mm (large)
- Inflorescence is panicle-like
	- Spikelets hang down (pendant) at maturity
- Awm is from back-middle side of lemma
	- Lemma tip has two membranous forks; awm is attached just beneath tip
- Spikelets are laterally compressed vs. dorsally compressed
### *Avena fatua*
- Wild oat
## *Festuca perennis*
- Rye grass
- Non-native
	- Formerly *Lolium perennis*
- Spike-like inflorescence
	- 1 glume on outside of spikelet
	- Sessile spikelet
	- Multiple florets laterally compressed (~10) and two-ranked
- Awms on tips of lemmae; variable lengths
## *Bromus*
- Brome, chess
- Some species are native
- Panicle-like or spike-like
- Glumes are less than width of the lower floret
- Lemma is two-forked and has a lengthy awn attached behind the tip
### *Bromus diandrus*
- Ripgut brome grass
- Panicle-like inflorescence
- Long awm attached to lemma
- Abrasive
