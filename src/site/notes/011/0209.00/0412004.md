# Bryophytes
- 290,000+ known species of land plants: mosses, ferns, gymnosperms, flowering plants
# Evolution of Land Plants
- Timeline
	- 1.2 bya — thin coating of cyanobacteria and protists, likely close to water
	- 500 mya — small plants, fungi, and animals on land
	- 470 mya — numerous fungal spore fossils
		- sporopollenin
	- 385 mya — taller plants (lignin)
- Plantae clade/supergroup, Viridiplantae, Streptophyta
	- Land plants: Embryophytes
	- Exclusive of charophytes
- Proteins that synthesize cellulose are arranged in a rosette, with sub-units derived from inside the cell center vs. linear proteins
- *Chara* — stonewort (calcium carbonate)
- *Coleochaete* — sporopollenin
- Land plants have various opportunities and challenges
	- More sunlight, more CO2 available
	- Nutrients no longer bathe plants (mycorrhizae), issues competing for sunlight
	- All plants adapt to dry land via
		- Alteration of Generations lifecycle
			- Oogamous
			- vs. charophytes
			- spores are protected against dessication and can opt to grow into gametophyte
		- Multicellular sporangia that produce “Walled spores”
			- Division/differentiation for walls
			- Sporopollenin: Spores and pollen greens, tough and resistant, hard to digest
		- Multicellular gametangia in most plant phyla
			- Multiple cells protecting the egg and sperm being made
			- Consistent structure
			- Egg producing gametangium is the archegonium
				- Flask/pear shaped
				- Has a larger venter (egg) and a neck that sperm swims through
			- Sperm producing gametangium is the antheridium
				- Oval/spherical
			- Surrounded by a layer: sterile jacket; both outside on the gametangiumm and on each individual
		- Multicellular young sporophyte is retained and nourished by the parent: embryo
			- Advancement over single zygotes not protected/nourished
		- 3-dimensional apical meristems
			- three-dimensional grrowth vs. intertwined filaments (parenchymatous) growth
# Bryophytes
- Non-vascular plants; no vascular tissue
- Paraphyletic group/**Grade of evolution**
- No lignin for conducting cells of xylem → no true vascular tissue
- May have rhizoids: unicellular or filamentous structures that anchor the plant in place; no need for absorptive structure, can dessicate
- No true leaves; no veins/vascular tissue (no roots, stems)
- **Gametophyte is the dominant generation**
	- Bisexual or Unisexual
	- Male gametophyte is a antheridium sperm, female is an archegonium sperm
	- Releases and swims through a film of water; fertilizes egg and forms a diploid zygote
	- Zygote divides through mitosis to form embryo, then sporophyte
	- One spore producing structure: sporangium
	- Meiosis of diploid cells: **sporocytes**
- Swimming sperm
- Dominant gametophyte, reduced and dependent sporophyte
## Bryophyta
- Mosses phylum
- Leafy area at bottom is dominant gametophyte
- Stalk is the sporophyte; non-dominant, ephemeral
- Three classes of mosses
- Wet/moist areas, cold, volcanic area
- Spiral arrangement of “leaves” around the central axis
- Upright growth supported by thicker cell walls, not lignin
- Can completely dry out and rehydrate; poikilohydry
- Mostly haploid; two part haploid stage
	- Haploid spores germinate and form filamentous green mass: protonema(ta)
	- Bulbles/buds: main part of gametophyte developing
	- Gives rise to leafy gametophyte
		- Many are bisexual, but have different stems that are unisexual
		- Some are single-sex
		- Sexual structures are on top of gametophyte, on top of stem: antheridial/archegonial head
			- Sterile hairs
			- Archegonial head has longer, stalked structures beneath venter
			- Venter is torn in two, then carried upwards and enlarges: calyptra
			- Venter falling off allows spore dispersal; leaves cap of sporangium (operculum) and peristome teeth that disperse spores
		- Three parts of gametophyte
			- Capsule: Sporangium
			- Seta: Stalk
			- Foot: Anchors to gametophyte
		- Characteristics of sporophyte

	- Bogmen left behind, preserved with hair and skin; “Tollund Man”
	- Ecological importance: 3% of land mass and accumulate 30% of soil carbon
		- vs. dessication via climate change; increased rates of decomposition and carbon release
- Peat: compressed, partially decomposed plant matter

## Reproductive Cycle
- Stigma holds pollen grain in place
- Pollen grain absorbs water
- Pollen grain tube cell takes signal; forms pollen tube
	- Going through transmitting tissue in the style, the placenta, and entering the embryo sac
- Synergids break down and emit attractive chemicals
- Pollen grain enters tube, through synergid, into egg
	- One sperm nucleus forms zygote → embryo
	- One sperm nucleus fuses with two polar nuclei of central cell → the triploid nucleus of the endosperm
- Ovary ripens into a dry or fleshy fruit
	- Dry endosperm or fleshy cotyledons inside the fruit
- Multiple pollen entering during pollination; competitive fertilization
## Pollen Grain
- Wall structure has two main parts:
	- Exine: Outer structure; highly sculptured and made from sporopollenin
	- Intine: Solid continuous layer inner structure; made from cellulose
- Exine is coated with materials from the microsporangium’s tapetum
## Outcrossing
- Outcrossing: Breeding between two different organisms
- Vs. Selfing
- Self-Incompatibility methods
- May also increase via
	- Differences in timing of maturation (pollen matures faster than stigma, or vice versa)
	- Dioecious vs. monoecious development
		- Foolproof
### Self-Incompatibility
- Foolproof Self-Incompatibility
	- Rejection of the self’s locus/pollen
	- Controlled by alleles at the S locus
- Two forms of self-incompatibility
#### Gametophytic
- Easier form
- If the pollen grain’s S allele matches either the allele on the stigma or style, a pollen tube will not grow
- Haploid, single allele
- Crop plants: potato/tomato family
- GSI
#### Sporophytic
- If tapetum materials match the alleles on the stigma or style, the grain will not germinate
- Diploid, two alleles
