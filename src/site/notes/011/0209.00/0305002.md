# Ecosystems
- An ecosystem has a **biotic** unit and an **abiotic** unit; living vs. non-living
	- **Biotic:** organisms, community, prey/food
	- **Abiotic:** oxygen, nutrients, water (and the availability of all of these units)
- **Limiting factors:** the combination of biotic and abiotic factors which can check the size of a population
- An ecosystem is **divided into:**
	- **Producers/Autotrophs:** Plants and cyanobacteria
	- **Consumers:** Animals
	- **Decomposers:** Bacteria, fungi, microorganisms
- Ecosystems contain **complexity** through species **stability** and <u></u>**carrying capacity**
	- **Carrying Capacity:** the maximum population that an ecosystem can support in the long term
		- Carrying capacity is never in <u>stasis</u>, but fluctuates around a given average depending on environmental factors
	- **Stability** prevents extinction and population die-offs; instability is induced by reducing attachments to a greater food web
## Producers
- **Autotrophic processes: Photosynthesis and Chemosynthesis**
	- **Photosynthesis** converts sunlight energy into chemical energy; carbon dioxide → oxygen, and light energy → sugars (glucose); plants and cyanobacteria
	- **Chemosynthesis** converts chemicals (sulfur) into carbon compounds; bacteria
- Producers undergo cellular  respiration, but use less glucose and oxygen than they photo/chemosynthesize
- **Gross Primary Productivity (GPP):** the total amount of energy converted from an inorganic form to an organic form
	- **Net Primary Productivity (NPP):** the amount of organic energy remaining after part of the gross primary productivity is consumed by producers to survive
		- Net productivity is determined via biomass and cells (in units of g/m<sup>^2</sup> per year)
		- **Tropical rainforests, marshland/estuaries, & coral reefs have the highest productivity** at 2,500 g/m^2
		- **Temperate evergreens** follow at 1,300 g/m^2
		- **Woodlands** at 700 g/m^2
		- **Cultivated land** is around 650, but can value much higher
		- **Deserts** lowest at 90 g/m^2
## Consumers and Decomposers
- Both are **heterotrophs**
	- Consumers, Detritivores, and Decomposers
- **Sole heterotrophic process: cellular respiration**
- Food web; *primary, secondary, tertiary consumers*, etc.
## Energy Transfer Efficiency
- Only 10% of the total energy is net transferred across each trophic level; all of the energy is consumed, but the 90% excluded is burned in order to consume prey and maintain processes to stay alive
- This net transfer/loss includes energy obtained by decomposers

## Ecosystem Cycles
- various methods of **nutrient cycling**
### Carbon Cycle
- primarily in the form of a gas, CO2
---
1. CO2 is used in **photosynthesis** by producers and converted
2. Heterotrophs **consume** organic forms of energy which were made from CO2
3. Heterotrophs perform **cellular respiration**, releasing CO2
### Nitrogen Cycle
- Nitrogen is the basis of proteins and DNA (nucleic acid)
- 78% of the atmosphere is stable nitrogen gas; difficult to break apart
- Nitrogen-fixing bacteria converts nitrogen into ammonia
	- Prominently performed by cyanobacteria
	- Nitrifying bacteria in soil
- Algae blooms in excess nitrogen
---
1. **Nitrogen gas is converted by bacteria** to solid ammonia
2. Ammonia is **biologically assimilated** into bacteria
3. Bacteria undergoes **decomposition**
- **Two outcomes:**
	1. Decomposed ammonia is **taken in by plants**/cycled
	2. Or ammonia is **denitrified**; converts back into nitrogen gas
		- Denitrifying bacteria
### Phosphate/Phosphorus cycle
- Phosphorus: nutrient in the soil, uptake by plants, use in animal skeletons, genetic material, ATP
---
1. Phosphorus is used in **photosynthesis** by producers and converted into glucose
2. Heterotrophs **consume** glucose
3. Heterotrophs release phosphorus via **cell respiration and decomposition**
### Water/Hydrologic Cycle
- Not a nutrient, but a major component (photosynthesis)
- Complex; ground, surface, plant components involved
- A system of flows and stores
---
1. **Evaporation** off of a body of water/source; sunlight/heat energy converts into vapor
	- *Evapotranspiration* in plants → evaporation
2. Vapor rises through altitude levels and cools; water molecules are dense; **condensate**, bind, and attract via polarity; reduces surface space
3. Cloud mass forms and cools; water droplets are pulled by gravity → **precipitation** as rain, hail, sleet, snow
- **Multiple outcomes:**
	- Plant uptake; water loss becomes **transpiration**
	- **Surface runoff** on hardscape or oversaturated surfaces
	- **Infiltration** into ground → groundwater
# Note on Structural Levels
- **Population:** All of the members of one species in a given place and time
- **Habitat:** A location in the ecosystem in which a population lives
- **Community:** The collection of populations in an ecosystem at a given time
- **Ecosystem:** The environment and the community that lives on it
- **Biosphere:** Every ecosystem in a given planet; every area in which life can be supported
# Characteristics of Populations
- Population characteristics change over various macroscopic variables:
	- Time, season;
	- Density, volume, area;
	- Migration, behavior;
- Measuring via the mark-recapture method
	- Equation: (Marked value \* Recaptured value)/Value of recaptured marked organisms
# Population Models
## Distribution Patterns
- Characteristics have various patterns/models dependent on the resources in the area
- **Dispersal/Distribution Patterns:**
	- **Clumped Dispersal:** Resource availability is limited to given areas
	- **Uniform Dispersal:** Resource rarity (Allelopathy, competition)
	- **Random Dispersal:** Resource abundance
## Growth Models
- **Growth Models:**
	- **Exponential Growth:** Unlimited/Infinite Growth
	- **Logistic Growth:** Limited Growth; Capstone/Upper limit (Mortality factors, carrying capacity)
### Carrying Capacity
- **Carrying Capacity:** The maximum number of individuals of a population that an environment can support in the long-term at the time of observation
	- Carrying capacity is equal in terms of biomass and unequal in terms of numerical value
## Mortality Models
- **Mortality:** The rate at which deaths are affected by limiting factors in the environment
	- Two forms: Density-dependent and density-independent mortality
	- Seasonal surplus populations will be reduced by mortality factors
### Density-Dependent Mortality
- **Density-Dependent Mortality:** Population size ultimately affects the limiting factors of the environment and the mortality rate
	- Related to population crowding
- **Compensatory Mortality:** One mortality factor increases to compensate for the reduction of another mortality factor
- Examples include:
	- Predation;
	- Diseases and parasites in a population distribution;
	- Density-related accidents (weight and numbers);
	- Limited physical resources;
	- Social stresses
### Density-Independent Mortality
- **Density-Independent Mortality:** Population size is unrelated to the limiting factors in the environment and the mortality rate
- Catastrophic events independent of population crowding
- Examples include:
	- Adverse weather;
	- Fire;
	- Flooding;
	- Certain types of accidents
## Growth Rates and Growth Rate Models
- **Biotic Potential:** The maximum reproductive rate of a population at a given time
- **Environmental Resistance:** Environmental factors that limit the biotic potential of a population via increased mortality rates or decreased birth rates
- Equation: Biotic potential - environmental resistance = Carrying capacity
	- As a population approaches carrying capacity, the mortality rate increases until reaching equilibrium
## Survivorship Curves
- Four types:
	- Early loss;
	- Constant loss;
	- Late loss;
	- Mix of early-late loss
### Early Loss
- Early loss: High initial with a rapid dropoff/death rate that declines with age
- Trees, angiosperms
### Constant Loss
- Constant loss: The mortality rate of organisms is constant across lifetime
- Birds, raptors
### Late Loss
- Late loss: High initial that remains stable before rapidly dropping off in old age
- Humans, elephants
### Mix of Early-Late Loss
- Mix of Early-Late Loss: Begins as early loss, then levels off, then drops off ala late loss when older
## Age Structures
- Pyramidic structures
- Provides information on if a population is growing, stable, or declining
- Graphs data of numbers in pre-reproductive, reproductive, and post-reproductive stages; typically, in all three shapes/patterns, post-reproductive bars are shorter than other bars
- The smaller the pre-reproductive bar is relative to the reproductive bar, the more the population is in decline; versus. growing or stability
## Birth Strategies
- How births occur in wild populations
	- Middle ground and extreme
	- *r*-factored or *r*-related birth
	- *K*-strategy
- *r-K* scale: based on two factors, *r* and *K*
### Rate Selection
- *r*-selected
	- **High birth rate, high number of offspring**
	- **High mortality and low recruitment**
	- **Low parental investment**
	- **High adaptability and short generation times**
- Goldfish, salmon, bacteria, houseflies
	- Antibiotic resistance
### Carrying Capacity Selection
- *K*-strategy / priority
	- **Low birth rate, slow gestation period, and low number of offspring**
	- **Low mortality;** offspring typically survive
	- **High recruitment rates:** offspring typically survive and develop to reproductive stage
	- High parental investment in childbirth
	- **Low adaptability, long generation times:** slower rates of evolutionary, genetic change
- Gorillas, whales, humans
# Community-Related Definitions
- **Diversity:** The variety of organisms typically found in an ecosystem, location, or habitat
- **Species Richness:** The numerical/adjectival value of diversity
- **Relative Abundance:** Commonality/prevalence of a species within a given place and time
- **Prevalent Forms of Vegetation:** The spatially dominant plants in an area
- **Stability:** The ability of a habitat to rebound from disturbances and mortality factors and to resist changes upon the environment
- **Trophic Structure:** Food consumption and transference of energy within ecosystems
- **Niche:** Consists of both biotic and abiotic resources used by an organism, as well as where, when, and how they use these resources
	- Ecological vs. market niche
# Community Models
- Regarding the full community
## Species Interactions
### Competition
- **Interspecific Competition:** Different species
- **Intraspecific Competition:** Same species
- Competition results in increased energy expenditures, so it is a large factor in natural selection
- **Principle of Competitive Exclusion:** Two or more species competing for the same resources at an extended length of time will cause at least one species to be detrimentally affected;
	- Three options presented to species: Redistribution/movement, adaptation, or extinction
	- Competitive exclusion results in resource partitioning
### Parasitism
### Commensalism
- One benefits, one is unaffected
- Horses and egrets; Whales and barnacles
### Mutualism
## Predator-Prey Interactions
### Prey Defenses
- Prey Physical Defenses:
	- Constitutive defenses such as quills, exoskeletons, spines, etc.
	- Camouflage
	- Toxicity: Venom/Poison
		- Venomous → injection, typically neurological; used for hunting
		- Poisonous → consumption/ingestion
		- Noxious
- Fleeing
#### Mimicry
- Batesian Mimicry: A species imitates a toxic or noxious species’ appearance for protection
- Mullerian Mimicry: At least two species that are toxic or noxious look alike for mutual protection
### Predatory Defenses
- Predatory Tactics:
	- High intelligence
	- Black-and-white vision or high cones
	- Camouflage
## Co-evolution
- Pairs of species interacting frequently or closely
- Changes across one species are often reflected in changes in the other species;
	- Changes in traits across one species are a selective pressure versus the other species
- Bee-plant domation, ants and acacia
- May be mutualistic or competitive
## Keystone Species
- Species which ecosystems depend on to maintain the community
	- CA: giant kelp, bats, fungi, sea otters
	- SEUS: alligators
- **Keystone Predator:** A predator specialization for keystone species; controls overpopulation in a community to maintain diversity
- Keystone predator disruption causes **trophic cascade**
## Indicator Species
- Warning signs for changes/problems in an ecosystem or habitat
- Nudibranchs, stoneflies, mayflies, amphibians, pika
## Ecological Succession
- Progression of chronological species development
- Primary Succession: The first time any source of life exists on the site
- Secondary Succession: New life that develops after a mortality factor destabilizes/removes the original community
- Climax Community: A stabilized community following secondary succession
