# Mammalia
- Class in the phylum Chordata
- Radiative evolution in the Cenozoic Era after extinction of dinosaurs, 65mya
- Includes: tiny shrews, bats, elephants, blue whales
## Synapomorphies
### Various Skeletal Modifications
#### Double-jointed Jaw Joint
- **Dentary:** Lower jaw
- **Squamosal:** Upper jaw
- Dentary and Squamosal are jointed
#### Three-Bone Middle Ear
- **Three bones used in hearing**
- Sounds pass from eardrum into three bones:
	1. Malleus: Outermost
	2. Incus: Middle, lengthy tunnel
	3. Stapes: Innermost, ring-like
#### Oral Teeth & Enamel
- A set of teeth
	- Teeth are replaced once in life in most mammals (except whales, rodents)
	- Heterodont: Different forms of teeth
	- Homodont: Identical form of teeth
- Teeth have an enamel coating on their surface
- Heterodont teeth have different notable forms:
	1. Incisor
		- Sharp, blade-like form
		- Cuts into food
		- Most anterior
	2. Canine
		- Strong, pointed form
		- Tears food
	3. Premolar
		- In-between form of canines and molars
		- Tear and grind into food
	4. Molar
		- Broad, flat surface of form
		- Crushes and grinds food
		- Most posterior
- Teeth dentition is adapted to diet
	- Carnivores:
		- Large, pointed incisors and canines
		- Smaller, jagged premolars and molars
		- Varying diastema
		- Predation
		- Dogs and cats
	- Herbivores:

		- Modified incisors and canines, or absent canines
		- Larger diastema
		- Horses and deer
	- Omnivores:
		- 32 teeth
		- Bladelike incisors, pointed canines, varying numbers of each toothform
		- Narrow diastema
#### Occipital Condyles
- **Two knobs at the base of the skull that fit into the neck vertebrae**
- Cusped around the foramen magnum
#### Number of Vertebrae
- **The majority of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae**
	- Except manatees, two-toed sloths, and three-toed-sloths
#### Tetrapodality
- Phalanges → Metacarpals → Carpals → Ulna + Radius → Humerus
### Biological Modifications
- **Mammary glands produce milk for young**
- **Endothermic regulation:** High and constant body temperature
### Physiological Modifications
