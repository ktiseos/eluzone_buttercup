# Protists
- **Paraphyletic grouping** of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes
- Algae, Protozoa, Slime Molds
- Photosynthetic, Heterotrophic, Mixotrophic
- Various sexual life cycles
- Studied via samples, DNA fragments and overlapping sequence analysis; **environmental sequencing/metagenomics**
- Studied for…
	- Human Health Concerns (*Giardia lamblia*, Trypanosome, Malaria)
	- Ecological Issues
		- Primary producers/consumers
		- CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown to benthic reservoirs, outside of atmosphere
		- Algal blooms (red tides, toxins)
## Origin of Protists
- **Mitochondria: Endosymbiosis Theory**
	1. archaeal cell engulfed aerobic bacterium
	2. bacterium survived and formed an endosymbiotic relationship
	3. formation of mitochondria
- **Nuclear Envelope: Infolding Hypothesis**
	- infolding of plasma membrane surrounded chromosomes
	- created a double membrane with organelles (endoplasmic reticulum)
- **Chloroplast: Primary and Secondary Endosymbiosis**
	- **Primary Endosymbiosis:**
		- engulfed cyanobacteria; endosymbiosis theory
		- consider Gram bacteria
			- Gram-positive: thick cell wall of peptidoglycan on the outside
			- Gram-negative: thin cell wall of peptidoglycan with an outer phospholipid bilayer membrane (double membrane wall)
		- food vacuole contained one membrane, then cyanobacterium contained 2 membranes
		- one membrane was lost, resulting in a chloroplast with two bounding membranes
	- **Secondary Endosymbiosis:**
		- algal cell engulfed by a non-photosynthetic, heterotrophic eukaryote
			- either red or green algae
		- outer membrane of food vacuole, algal cell membrane, and two membranes of cyanobacterium
		- results in up to four membranes around chloroplast
		- also sometimes contains a remnant nucleus from the algal cell: **nucleomorph**
			- reduced set of genes and often a membrane
		- may have occurred multiple times depending on algaee
	- occurred in Archaeplastida (Plantae)
## Eukaryotic supergroups/clade
### Excavata
- excavated feeding groove
- Diplomonads, Parabasalids, Eugleenozoans
### Archaeplastida
- AKA Plantae supergroup
	- “Ancient plastids” — first evolution of plastids
- **Underwent two endosymbiotic events:**
	- **primary endosymbiosis** in all cases
	- **secondary endosymbiosis** in many cases

## Characteristics
### Morphology
- Two growth forms
	- Unicellular growth form → Yeast
	- Most are multicellular and filamentous: filaments are hyphae, and masses of hyphae are mycelium
		- High surface area to volume ratio from thin hyphae
		- Vulnerable to dessication
- Hyphae have different septation
	- Crosswalls between hyphae: Septate
	- No crosswalls: Aseptate/Coenocytic
- Cell walls are made of chitin; no cellulose
	- Chitin polymer; B1, 4 linkages
	- Polysaccharide with highly modified sugars
		- Glucose replaced by a nitrogen containing group
	- Straight, stronger than cellulose, more possibilities for hydrogen bonding between parallel molecules due to nitrogen-containing group
- Hyphae undergo **hyphal extension**
	- Hypha tip is not hardened, plastic
	- Tip of hypha extends due to increased turgor pressure
	- Growth is performed throughout the hypha, but material is sent through the hypha to the tip
	- Older cell walls are hardened and do not expand
	- Most hyphae grow away from other hyphae
		- If they find food, they branch towards it extensively and may fuse with other hyphae
- Cell wall formation in cytokinesis is different from both plants and animals; no pinching in, no formation of new cell wall
### Spores
- Fungi make spores through sexual and asexual lifecycles; generally thrrough both in most fungi
	- Main reproductive cells
- Unicellular, dispersal spores that do not fuse/fertilize; can divide by mitosis to make mycelium without fertilization
	- Thick walls, protective against dessication
	- Some are not thick and softer
	- Carried by wind currents
### Life Cycle
- Modified haploid life cycle
- Deuteromycetes: “unable to see” sexual reproduction
	- No longer used
#### Asexual Reproduction
- Genetically identical haploid spores
- Developed via mitosis
#### Sexual Reproduction
- Fertilization is separated into two parts/sections: plasmogamy and karyogamy
	- These phases occur in all fertilization, but are so divided in fungi they can be distinguished as two phases
	- Plasmogamy fuses cytoplasm
	- Karyogamy fuses nuclei
	- In between plasmogamy and karyogamy: cell/hypha is heterokaryotic as it has two types of nuclei in the cell
		- Monokaryotic: One nucleus in the cell
		- Heterokaryotic: Two types of many haploid nucleus in the cell
		- Dikaryotic: A specialization of heterokaryotic; two nuclei in each cell, both which are heterokaryotic
## Basal Fungi
- Generally parasitic, unicellular
- Some differences between phyla
### Cryptomycetes
- Flagellated spores
- *Rozella*
- attacks fungi and protists
### Microsporidia
- Non-flagellate spores
- **Reduced genomes and mitochondria; relies on hosts for ATP**
- *Nosema* sp. — **(honeybee) colony collapse disorder**

	- other possible factors: insecticides, mite species
	- affects hormones in worker bees, delaying role reception
## Chytridiomycota
- Chytrids
- Common to soil and water
- Decomposers/saprophytic

- Different functions
	- Digests cellulose in guts of cattle and sheep after consuming grass
	- Causes **chytridiomycosis in amphibians (chytrid disease)**
		- Disease of the skin
		- Worldwide decline in amphibian populations such as frogs
		- Skin thickens and prevents breathing through skin
## Zoopagomycota
- Diverse: parasitic, saprophytic
## Mucoromycota

- Aerial coenocytic cells
- Sporangium forms around/in a hollow columella
	- Asexual spores made via mitosis
	- Spores spread once sporangium is broken open
- Sexual life cycle is heterothallic; must have different mating genes (+/-)
	- Constantly secreting materials into environment and able to detect mating partners
	- Gametangia from mating strains held together by suspensors
	- Merging of gametangia forms zygosporangium
	- Zygosporangium stores zygospore with two nuclei
	- Zygosporangium produces hypha and spores that are genetically different
### Glomeromycotina
- Subphylum
- An endomycorrhizae phylum; arbuscular mycorrhizae
	- Found in 80% of land plants, but only 160 species of fungi important to arbuscular mycorrhizae
	- No 1:1 relationship between fungi and land plants
- Oldest filamentous fungi in record
- Hypha forms highly branched structures inside plant cell: **arbuscule**

		- Hymenium: Layer of asci (ascus) sacs and ascospores
			- End cell of dikaryotic hyphae is the ascus
			- Ascus: Karyogamy occurs; diploid cell
			- Meiosis → Haploid state
			- Mitosis → 8 nuclei
			- Spores → 8 spores (ascospores) produced in each ascus
	- Spore germination breaks through ascus

- Dikaryotic hyphae
- 50,000 species
- mushrooms, puffballs, shelf fungi, smuts, rusts
- club fungi: basidium’s club shape
- hyphae are generally septate with pores and membrane caps limiting flow of organelles between pores
- Homothallic
- No gametangia; hyphae fuse and form dikaryotic mycelium/2dary mycelium
- Dikaryotic mycelium is the longterm feeding phase
- Entire basidiocarp is made only of dikaryotic hyphae
- Cap → pilus
