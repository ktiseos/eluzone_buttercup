## Hierarchy of Federal Law
1. The U.S. Constitution
2. Federal Statutes (Laws)
	- Federal regulations are based on federal law
	- Tied with international treaties
		- Most recent is the tiebreaker
	- All superior to state law
3. International treaties
	- Tied with federal statutes
		- Most recent is the tiebreaker
4. Federal regulations
	- Developed and adopted by federal departments and federal agencies
5. State constitutions, state laws
6. Local ordinances
## State Constitutions
- Basis for state law and legal procedures
- Must abide by federal constitution; cannot contravene constitution
- Separation of state and federal law, separation of pre-eminence
## State Regulation
- Cannot regulate federal agency activities with two exceptions:
	1. State regulation of federal agencies for **environmental regulations**
		- Authorized by Congress
		- CA Regional Water Quality Boards and Clean Water Act Section 401
	2. State jurisdiction with federal regulatory activity; if the activity is unconstitutional to the state’s constitution
## Courts
- Court decisions can modify law or modify implementation of law
- Hierarchy:
	1. U.S. Supreme Court
		- Congress can appeal law that is deemed “unconstitutional”
	2. U.S. Court of Appeals
	3. U.S. District Courts
	4. U.S. Court of Claims
	5. State Courts
		- State Supreme Court

- Life tenure unless:
	- Resignation
	- Retire
	- Death
	- Senior status

		- never happened lolmao
- Selective case petitions/hearings for “compelling reasons”
	- Issues in conflict with the interpretation of federal law or constitutional provisions
	- Correcting an egregious departure from standard/socially accepted course of proceedings (constitutional)
	- Resolving a question of federal law of great importance or reviewing a decision from a lower court that conflicts with a previous decision made by the Supreme Court
- ~10,000 petitions per year; only 75-80 heard and 50-60 reviewed by paper
### Circuit Court of Appeal
- 179 judges
	- Lifetime appointment
- 13 districts
	- DC Circuit
	- Federal Circuit
	- Largest: 9th circuit (29)
	- Smallest: 1st (6)
- 3 judge panels; may be higher due to controversy, but generally 3
- Most powerful and influential courts
	- Legal precedents cover millions of people and have strong policy influence
	- Hears more cases than Supreme Court; often final arbiter on federal cases
### Federal District Court
- Basic jurisdictional trial court
## Lawmaking
- Congress is the only entity that enacts law
	- Federal Departments and Agencies regulate law and authority
- Law is superior to regulations, executive orders, executive memoranda, and proclamations
	- Executive proclamations: similar to executive orders, but are directed to entities and persons **outside of government**
		- EO aims at those inside government
- Agencies can be granted broad authority to interpret U.S.C. and enforce statutes
	- “Rulemaking” of detailed rules and regulations
	- Rules and regulations are federally published via the federal register before becoming enforceable
		- Prior must receive public comments during the “rulemaking” process

# National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
- Instructs how and when federal projects should be reviewed for environmental impacts
	- Enforced by private action: groups can sue companies that fail to perform sufficient review
- Brief; ~6 pages in length
	- Individual agencies must interpret and develop regulations
	- Extensive coverage of agencies and activities
	- All federal agencies must determine, disclose, and consider environmental impacts
		- Except Congress, federal judiciary, and Office of the President
		- Does not require particular decisions/actions made; “does not impose a substantive duty”
		- Essentially procedural, not substantive; establishes a process for consideration
		- Allows broad discretion regarding degree of substantive environmental protection deemed necessary by agencies
	- Includes ecosystem factors and ecological relationship factors
- Officially establishes:
	1. U.S. environmental policy
	2. Interdisciplinary framework for environmental planning for federal agencies
	3. Action-forcing procedures; requirements to consider environmental impacts
### Specific Purposes
1. Declare a national policy that encourages “productive and enjoyable harmony” between humans and environment
2. Promotes efforts to reduce impacts to environment and biosphere and improve human health and welfare
3. Enrich understanding of ecosystems, ecology, and important natural resources
4. Establishes CEQ

- Developed six fundamental objectives:
	1. Supplemental Legal Authority: Adds responsibility and power for protecting and integrating the environment as an authority of federal agencies
	2. Procedural Reform: Requires federal agencies to consider future and interdisciplinary impacts of current decisions
	3. Disclosure of Environmental Information: Requires equal regard of environmental concerns with technical, social, and economic concerns
	4. Resolution of Environmental Problems: Requires looking for solutions to environmental problems through disclosure and evaluation of alternatives and mitigative efforts
	5. Fostering Intergovernmental Coordination and Cooperation: Requires cooperation between federal agencies, non-federal governments, and tribal organizations
	6. Enhancing Public Participation in Government Planning and Decision Making: Adds new, innovative ways for the public to be involved in federal activities and requires federal response to public comments

- Section 101:
	- Fulfill each generation’s responsibility as a “trustee of the environment”
	- Assure safe, healthy, productive environment and preserve historical, cultural, natural aspects of national heritage
	- Maximize beneficial uses of environment without high impact; enhance quality of renewable resources; balance population and resource use
- Section 102:
	- Environmental Impact Statements necessary for proposed legislation or major federal actions that “significantly affect the quality of the human environment”
	- EIS must include impacts, any unavoidable adverse effects, alternative actions, the relationship between short-term use of human environment and long-term maintenance of productivity, and any irreversible uses of resources necessary
### Usage
- Process reduced to:
	1. Determine if NEPA applies
	2. Determine whether to prepare an EIS or an EA (Environmental Assessment, briefer) for review
	3. Prepare document
	4. Make a decision based on considerations in the EA/EIS
### Documents/Processes Involved
- EIS: Most rigorous and comprehensive document
	- Must be prepared if there is a “federal action that significantly affects quality of human environment”
	- Action is an agency proposal, agency inaction, or the proposal of legislation by a federal agency
	- Federal action is an action potentially subject to federal responsibility, and it only affects the level of federal involvement in a larger private activity
	- Significance is determined based on the agency acting; CE must be adopted to avoid usage of NEPA documentation
- EA: Examination of impacts of an action that determines ultimately if an EIS is necessary
- FONSI (Finding of No Significant Impact): Issued when an EA is completed
- CE (Categorical Exclusion)
	- Occurs if extraordinary circumstances are absent
- ROD (Record of Decision): Written public record explaining why an agency takes a specific course of action
### EIS
- Lawsuits can be performed under Administrative Procedure Act if procedure was not complied; enforces use of EIS
- EIS assures any environmentally informed decision making is ongoing
- Procedural requirement rather than a substantive duty; utilized a dynamic that encourages process, public involvement, and considering multiple impacts and alternatives; practicable
- Lead agency prepares EIS; joint lead agencies may be present, as well as independent consultants/contractors; federal official is responsible for guidance, oversight, and adequacy
- Preceded by scoping
	- DEIS: Draft EIS
	- FEIS: Final EIS
#### EA
- Contains description of environmental impacts, discussion of the need for the proposal and alternatives, listing of agencies and persons consulted, and explanation on why it may not have significant effect on environment
- Around 15 pages generally
### Effects
- Opens and broadens decision-making; most projects are not halted
	- First priority is to avoid proposing projects and programs that can cause unacceptable impacts
	- Second priority: Mitigation measures are proposed to eliminate or greatly reduce impacts
- Effects all federal agencies with discretionary authority
	- One federal agency serves as “lead agency”
		- If multiple agencies are involved, lead agency is determined based on magnitude of an agency’s involvement, level of approval authority, level of expertise, duration of agency’s involvement, and sequence of involvement
	- Implementations affect various stakeholders: Concerned Federal Agencies, State Agencies, Local Governments, Tribes and Nations, Third-party contractors, Special Interest groups, and “Interested Citizens”
	- CEQ and EPA administer, oversee, and review NEPA at a national level
## History and Involvement
- Passed in Congress in 1969, signed 1/1/1970
- 1970-1990; poor acclimation and adjustment to NEPA
	- 1998–2018: 500 drafts and final EISs filed each year
	- Most documents filed by the DOA (Forest/Land Management); DOT (Roadways); Interior (Species/Habitat Protection); USACOE (CWA/RHA)
	- Average 742 pages in 2006, 400 in 2019
- Most copied U.S. Statute; ~100 countries have adopted EIS provisions (environmental impact assessment)
	- Systematic, interdisciplinary approach with broad consultation and public review
	- Also copied into State Environmental Policy Acts; some make laws substantive
- U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: Past criticism → Highly adherent
- U.S. DOE: Less adapted
- CEQ: Supervisor and coordinator for NEPA
	- January 2025 CEQ EOs
- EIS typically completed within five years after Notice of Intent (68.4%)
	- 24.1% completed within six to ten years
	- Total 92.5% completed within ten years
- High numbers of NEPA actions
	- 158316/166718 = CE
	- 7596 = EA
	- 499 = EIS
- Military and Homeland Security are exempted from NEPA
	- Military regularly follows NEPA procedure/clearance
	- DHS is not forthright with documentation; detention facilities
#### CEQ
- CEQ is responsible for promulgating NEPA requirements, coordinating environmental policies, and publishing annual report on state of U.S. environment
- Functions:
	- Assists and advises President with annual report
	- Analyzes conditions and trends in environmental quality
	- Reviews and appraises federal compliance
	- Develops and recommends national policies to promote environmental quality to President
	- Documents and defines changes and trends
	- Reports annually
	- Makes recommendations with respect to environmental policies and legislation
- Responsible for issuing regulation and guidance with NEPA compliance, resolving lead agency disputes, mediating interagency disputes, and training/advising federal agencies
- Effectiveness and involvement is dependent/reliant on environmental policies of president
#### USEPA
- More limited; responsible for implementation
- Functions:
	1. Reviewing Role: Reviews EIS in public review period and may refer to CEQ if it deems action is unsatisfactory from the view of public health, welfare, or environmental quality
	2. Filing and Noticing Role: Lists EIS in Federal Register
	3. Cooperating Agency Role: Participates in the lead agency’s NEPA process and cooperates with agency based on involvement of EPA regulatory programs (Clean Water Act implementation)
### Recent History
- Trump II Administration
	- CEQ cannot release binding regulations regarding NEPA
	- CEQ must release regulations that weaken NEPA
- NEPA documents streamlined
	- ~170 documents of highest analysis level (EIS) per year
	- Technical data is now appendiced
- Weakened in Trump I administration: promoted developmental interest and eliminated aspects of NEPA
- Aspects returned by Biden administration through EO
- Biden Administration signed **Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023** June 3 2023
	- Caused reversion of some Trump administration implementations and new provisions
	- Streamlined the environmental review process
		1. Codified existence of one federal lead agency
		2. Limited time and page length of EA and EIS (without appendices or extension by consultation of an applicant or court); 75pg/1yr for EA, 150pg/2yr for EIS
		3. Allowed FLA to designate project sponsors, including non-agency sponsors, who can prepare EA or EIS for the agency under their supervision
		4. Defined major federal action as “an action that the agency carrying out such action determines that is subject to substantial Federal control and responsibility”, and defines what are not major federal actions (not what are major federal actions; examples include general revenue-sharing funds with no federal oversight, loans provided by small business administration or non-federal agencies, judicial/administrative criminal enforcement actions)
		5. Validates programmatic NEPA documents (broad, high-level reviews) for five years barring any new circumstances or information that affect the impacts analyzed, and invalidates them unless reevaluated
		6. Allows usage of Categorical Exclusions across federal agencies if the agency is consulted, the public is informed, and the adoption is documented
		7. Modernizing NEPA via the use of a Permitting Portal Study (cloud-based portal; currently at study-level)
		8. Requires all agencies to analyze impacts based on the No-Action Alternative
- Biden Administration also utilized **CEQ Phase 1 and Phase 2** (2022, 2023) Revisions
	- FRA wrote Phase 2 Revisions cannot overrule provisions in FRA
	- Strengthens many provisions as long as situations do not conflict with FRA; FRA will take precedence over conflicting CEQ revision
- Overall Biden changes make it more difficult to change NEPA via policy changes
	- Would need to “starve” agencies of funding, staffing, etc.
	- Would need to limit public input with NEPA processes, and limit judicial action
# Types of Law
- Three major types of law present
	- Substantive Law: Determines rights and obligations of individuals, collective entities (social behavior)
	- Procedural Law: Determines procedure to implement law
	- Regulations: Incorporates both substantive and procedural law
- Types of Environmental Law:
	- Planning Laws: Instructs government to consider federal effects on environmental concerns; NEPA
	- Regulatory Law: Instructs society based on what it can and cannot do; CWA, CAA
	- Planning and Regulatory Law: Incorporates both federal impacts and regulation; FESA
# CEQA

		- WA, MT, SD, MN, WI, IN, NY, MA, CT, NJ, MD, NC, VA, GA, HI
	- Prior to CEQA, only economic and technical aspects of projects were considered; CEQA considers environmental aspects/impacts in a list that has expanded over time
- Goal: “develop and maintain a high-quality environment now and in the future”
	- Disclose to decision makers and public the potential significant environmental effects of proposed activities
	- Disclose to the public reasons for agency approval of projects with significant environmental effects
	- Foster interagency coordination in project review
	- Enhance public participation during the planning process of projects

	- **Negative Declaration**
		- Possible impacts considered in the initial study
		- Further studies and analysis
		- **Mitigated Negative Declaration:** Lead agency studies project and effects and mitigates or eliminates impacts
		- “Neg-decs”
		- Goes through public review
	- **Environmental Impact Report**

	- **Mandatory Findings of Significance**
		- A presentation of environmental impacts, data, evidence, and significance of impacts
	- **Statements of Overriding Consideration**
		- Benefits and merits of project
		- Why the project should be approved despite significant environmental categorical damage
- Interagency coordination is facilitated via:
	- Early and frequent consultation; early review with stakeholders
	- Scope/scoping meetings; project management
	- Notice of Preparation: Declaration of analysis preparation
	- State Clearing House Review
	- Draft and final
- Public participation is enhanced via:
	- Scoping
	- Public Notice Requirements
	- Responses to public comments
	- Legal enforcement procedures
	- Citizen access to courts; ability to sue projects under CEQA
- Public is designated as a “privileged position” in the CEQA process
	- “Watchdog” individuals and groups
- Various substantive requirements under CEQA

	- Agencies must avoid or minimize environmental damage when feasible
	- Agencies must prepare a Statement of Overriding Considerations if approving a project that has significant immitigable effects
	- Agencies must review effects on environmental resources such as air, water, traffic, fish and wildlife, historical resources, environmental justice, climate change, etc.
- CEQA applies to all discretionary activities proposed and carried out by California governments and public agencies
	- Discretionary: Evaluated and approved to move forward
	- Does not apply to private activities without discretionary governmental approval
	- Various agencies involved
		- Any state, local, regional agency; any board, commission, or special destrict
		- Lead Agency carries out/approves a project, determines the scope of CEQA analysis and documentation necessary, and preparation of CEQA documents
		- Responsible Agency is an agency separate of the lead agency that has legal responsibility for carrying out/approving a project
		- Trustee Agency is an agency designated in a scoping that has jurisdiction over certain public resources but has no legal authority over carrying out/approving a project
			- CDFW, State Lands, Parks and Recreation, UC
- CEQA Guidelines provide primary rules and source of interpretation for CEQA
	- Yearly; Association of Environmental Professions
	- Courts generally defer to CEQA Guidelines
- Four directions based on CEQA Review
	1. Exemptions
		- Statutory (Law) Exemption

				- **Class 8.** Actions taken by regulatory agencies to assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment where the *regulatory process involves procedures* for protection of the environment
	2. Initial Study
		- Environmental, guideline-based “Check List”
		- Determines levels of impacts and non-lead agencies involved
	3. Negative Declaration/Mitigated Negative Declaration
		- Initial Study is attached with Neg-Dec
	4. Environmental Impact Report
- Results in
	- Project Alternatives
		- Alternative ways to approach project goals, without bias towards the proposed project (“preferred alternatives”)
		- No need for equal analytical detail between alternatives
		- Aiding in project description
		- **“No Project Alternative”** analysis: An alternative of if the project did not occur
		- Existing baseline conditions and regulatory limits
	- Mitigation Measures
		- Realistic and implementable measures; specific, measurable, and feasible
		- Must be adequate measures; measures requiring “consultation” or “further studies” alone may be invalid
		- Deferred mitigation is inadequate alone, but mitigation with partially deferred mitigation can be validated so long as the EIR specifies certain performance standards, including contingency plans for deferred mitigation plans
		- Mitigative measures incorporate into a project, but must be directly connected (nexus) to the impact they are ascribed to
	- Mitigation Monitoring
		- Reporting and adaptive management
		- Added to CEQA in 1989 (AB 3180)
		- Mitigation does not necessarily need to be successful unless criteria denotes it in a mitigation monitoring program, but must be undertaken
		- Provides feedback to agencies on effectiveness of decisions and learning experience to improve future mitigation requirements
		- Identifies if enforcement action is necessary before irreversible environmental damage under the project occurs (Enforced by non-CEQA statutes)
- Five categories of mitigation with various levels of preference
	- **Avoidance**
	- **Minimization**
	- **Rectification:** Repairing, rehabilitating, restoring impacted environmental factors
	- **Reduction or Elimination of Impact:** A dynamic mitigative factor preserving and performing maintenance on impacted environmental factors through the project’s lifetime
	- **Compensation:** Substitute resources or environments
- Significance thresholds: Quantitative and qualitative thresholds that determine if an impact is significant
	- Not generally described in CEQA or CEQA guidelines, but must be clearly identified before an initial study
		- **CEQA only defines a significant effect:** “A substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the project including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance.”
	- Usually extracted from confirmed projects with given standards or developed by local governments
