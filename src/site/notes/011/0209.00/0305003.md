# Geology
- Study of rocks, minerals
- Geological time scale, gradualism
- Basic components of earth’s crust:
	- 46.6%: Oxygen
	- 27.7%: Silica
		- Beaches
	- 8.1%: Aluminum
		- Most abundant mineral
	- 5.0%: Iron
- Others:
	- 3.6%: Calcium
	- 2.8%: Sodium
	- 2.6%: Potassium
	- 2.1%: Magnesium
	- Other elements are found at lower percentages: precious metals, etc.
## Minerals
- Element: One molecule composed of specific atomic units
- Mineral: One compound composed of one or more elements
	- Nutrients necessary for organisms to process for survival
	- Rocks release minerals through weathering and erosion
## Weathering
- Chemical process of releasing minerals
- Affected by several agents
### Water
- Chemical acidity
- Lattice structure of water → expansion when changing forms → surface tension
	- Expansion when freezing breaks down chunks of rocks
### Chemical Weathering
- Gases: CO<sub>2</sub>, Carbonic Acid
	- Carbonic acid breaks down marble, limestone, rocks, etc. via acidity
- Chemical reactions dissolve rock
### Rainwater
- Effective weathering agent
- Normal rainwater, not acid rain; is slightly acidic
	- Mixes with CO2 to form Carbonic Acid
	- Mixes with decaying material to form Carbonic Acid and Nitric Acid (stronger acid)
### Acid Rain
- Severe acidity
- Sulfur dioxide released in the atmosphere
	- Volcanoes, coal burning
- Sulfur dioxide and water forms sulfuric acid (battery acid)
- Nitrogen Oxide from cars and water forms Nitric Acid
## Erosion
- Physical processes
- Physically breaking apart/away sediments
- The faster water flows (higher velocity, higher energy) the more material it can carry; slower water releases materials
	- Sierra Nevada wears down by 1” every thousand years
### Water Erosion
- Hurling particles causing breakdown
- Carving and altering land shapes
#### Splash Erosion
- The impact of water drops (raindrops) on bare ground dislodges portions of the ground
#### Sheet Erosion
- Water on a mostly flat, inclined area gathers volume and velocity, eroding land under it
#### Gully Erosion
- Advanced sheet erosion
- Greater velocity
### Wind Erosion
- Geological pressures
- Tornadoes and hurricanes are extreme wind erosion
#### Santa Ana Winds
- High wind pressure
- Altitude in air
- High pressure in Nevada, low in Southern California; vacuum-like position of pressure on ground level
- Wind flows down into ground that is being pulled upwards: wind travels faster to try to replace volume
- Wind picks up sand/sediment and blows it into objects
- Santa Rosa firestorms
- The stronger the difference between air pressures, the stronger the wind/breeze that fills in
### Glacial Ice Erosion
- Glaciers in CA (~100), up to 1km
- Snow that does not melt fully, leaving behind an ice layer; some is left as runoff
- Glacier: Large block of ice pulled downwards with gravity
- Last ice age had glaciers on Sierra Nevada, Klamath, Cascade 10000 yrs ago; Yosemite carved valleys
- Sierra, Mt. Shasta, Trinity Alps
- Glacier depletion in CA, Alaska, etc. in retreat: extensive erosion/exposure of soils causing positive loop of melting
### Gravitational Erosion
## Rock Sediments
- Different subsections of three major types
- Sedimentary rock, igneous rock, metamorphic rock
### Sedimentary Rock
- Secondary rock
- Particles from weathering and erosion reform/compress into a new rock
- Sandstone
- Makes up ¾ of rocks found on surface and only 5% of those in crust
- Large amounts of sedimentary rock in CA as a result of exposure and covering by water through Ice Age and tectonic events from rising oceans/coasts
	- Central Valley: Water washed out, 1000ft sediments
	- Mountains have been uplifted and wearing down for millions of years; sediments end in Central Valley
#### Sierra Nevada Sedimentary Rock
- Many exposed rocks are igneous; sedimentary rock has eroded
- Still visible in areas of low rainfall: “spine”/crest at high elevation is present
	- Fossils, Trilobytes
### Igneous Rock
- Volcanic/plutonic rock
- Primary rocks formed from basal materials of magma and lava
- Formed above and under ground; many of it is underground
- Granite, basalt, pumice, obsidian
- Examples
	- **Sierra Nevada granite batholith**
		- batholith: large intrusion of igneous rock that cools over time; uplifted and eroded
	- Mount Lassen, Mount Shasta, Devil’s Postpile, Modoc Plateau, Sutter Buttes
		- Active cascading volcanoes
		- Basalt cooling
#### Slow-Cooling
- “Salt and pepper” look in granite
- “Coarse-grained”
- Larger crystals formed in rocks
#### Rapid-Cooling
- Some small or no crystals at all
- “Fine-grained”
- Pumice: Air bubbles
- Basalt
- Gaseous; dissolved gases inside and high pressure
	- “Bubbling out” and rapidly cooling
- Obsidian: black glass with no gas inside
### Metamorphic Rock
- Secondary rock
- Begins as igneous or sedimentary; tectonic activity causes them to be shoved underground towards heat sources and they change forms/characteristics
- Limestone → Marble; Shale → Slate
- Partially remelted and changed
- Mountainous areas common
### Rock Cycle
- Igneous → Metamorphic → Sedimentary
- Weathering agents/Exogenous forces act on igneous rocks and break them into sedimentary minerals
- Sediment is compressed into sedimentary rocks: Lithification
- Sedimentary rocks exposed to high heat from tectonic convergence, friction, and pressure bakes and changes into metamorphic rocks
- Exogenous forces can break all rocks into sediment
- Mantle through subduction → Igneous and metamorphic rocks
# Plate Tectonics
- Three plates: Juan de Fuca, Pacific, North American
	- Pacific moves west; Juan de Fuca moves east
- Grinding/friction; rocks melt
	- Volcanoes: Lassen, Shasta, Plateau
- San Andreas Fault
- Pacific Plate has a ring that intersects with various other intercontinental plates: Ring of Fire
	- High earthquake zones and volcanic activity on plate faults
- Devil’s hole
## Faults
- Foot-walls and hanging walls
- Ridge collapses
- Various deep faults under South California
	- San Andreas Fault
	- Fracture zones
	- Base of transverse range
	- Faults are unknown forms; large cause of urban destruction and utility risk
### Normal Fault
- Foot-wall is higher than hanging wall
### Reverse Fault
- Hanging wall is higher than foot-wall
- Overhang
### Strike-Slip Fault
- Foot-wall and hanging wall move horizontally away from each other
- 1906 earthquake
# Weather and Climate
- **Weather:** Daily, present variations in temperature, precipitation, winds, etc.
- **Climate:** Long-term and annual patterns in temperature, precipitation, winds, etc. in a region
- Climate is affected by:
	- Air masses moving across and around counties/locations; density of air masses and variables of air masses
	- Oceans and ocean currents; temperature, moisture, density
	- Topography and movement around topography
	- Latitude and angles of sunlight
		- Hemispheric seasons and angles
## Adiabatic Cooling
- Altitude is not elevational movement; altitude regards atmosphere
- Warm air rises; warm air molecules are lighter and less dense, less close
- Ground warms accepting heat
	- Directly above ground level is the warmest
- Air gets denser as it cools and enlarges
- Adiabatic cooling is present most in areas of rainfall, adiabatic warming is present in areas of desert
## Ocean Currents and Maritime Climate
- Cool water is bordered by denser air that is not heated by it and less moisture
	- California maritime climate
- Warm water is bordered by less dense air and more moisture
	- Florida **thunderstorms**
	- Sierra Nevada, especially at night
- Atmospheric effect
## Mediterranean Climate
- Seasonality of warm dry summers and cool wet winters
- Created by cold water current off coast and air masses moving from coast onto land alongside mountainous topography
- Mediterranean, California coast, North Africa, Chile, Southern and West Australia
- Close to 40\*N and S
## Orographic Precipitation
- Rain shadows
- Orographic effect
- Topographical
- Mountain ranges force air up which causes adiabatic cooling → rainfall
	- West side of mountain ranges:
		- Air rises
		- Adiabatic cooling
		- Condensation and precipitation
	- East side:
		- Adiabatic warming
		- Desert
			- Peninsular Range
			- Transverse Range
			- Southern Sierra Nevada
			- Sierra Nevada
			- Cascade Range
			- Big Sur area in Bakersfield
		- Rain shadow effect
		- Evaporation from compression and warming
		- Air expands and dries; less relative humidity
		- No condensation or precipitation
