- “sin model of homosexuality”
- sexology: scientific, medicalized study of attraction
- contemporary understanding of homosexuality is founded on sexology
	- Michel Foucault, 1978, *History of Sexuality*: sexology created new categories of mental illnes and identities based on sexuality; instead of condemnation, it was personified by pathologization
# historical context
- end of 19thc
	- growing urbanization, middle class, industrialization, imperialism and colonialism
	- emergence of capitalism
		- “in a capitalist culture, it can be helpful to have distinct categories of individuals to whom to market goods and services”
	- scientific renaissance
	- changes in family structures; smaller familial units, romantic friendships
	- women’s rights
	- increased interaction with prostitution and “sexual underground” in urban environments
		- 1890, George Chauncey: “a highly visisble, remarkably complex, and continually changing gay male world”
	- visibility of sex and contraceptives
	- changes in 19thc led to birth of sexology
- “silent sin” of male homosexuality persisted
	- 1885: british criminal law amendment act
	- “sexual inversion” was an illness; described as “gross indecency”
- female sexual desire was pathological and damaging;
	- “nymphomaniac” behavior
	- paroxysm (orgasm) effectively treated hysteria
# history of sexology
- **1869**, Karl Westphal (1833–1890, physician): “contrary sexual feeling”, later renamed to “invert”
	- inverts believed to be more feminine or masculine than societal norms; “gender confusion”
	- “The supposed link between deviation from sex and gender norms and homosexuality continues as a fundamental assumption underlying many studies throughout the 20th century and into the 21st”
- **1869**, Karl Maria Kertbeny (writer): invention of homosexual term for same-sex interest
- **1886**, Dr. Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840–1902, psychiatrist): *Psychopathia Sexualis* — “sexual perversions”, “abnormal **congenital** manifestations”; same-sex manifestations occur from desire of sexual sensibility for opposite sex
	- later invention of masochism, fetishism, and sadism
	- homosexuality was congenital or caused through other **etiologies**
	- homosexuality was avoided or pitied; mental illness
	- use of heterosexual as opposite-sex relations that did not aim to cause reproduction
- **1864–1880**, Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (1825–1895, law/theology student): “third sex” of homosexuals: **Urnings**
	- urnings result from heredity, not abnormal; attempted normalization of condition, or “reverse discourse”
- **before 1903**: final edition of *Psychopathia Sexualis*; homosexuality manifested from sexual desire, not mental illness
# Havelock Ellis
- 1859–1939, physician on the 20thc
- *Sexual Inversion*, 1897: “a fair and scientific representation of homosexuality”
- *Studies in the Psychology of Sex*, 1937: various sexual practices: inversion and homosexuality
	- male inversion: primarily focused on same-sex attraction
	- female inversion: same frequency; continued theory of inversion (“gender confusion”)
	- homosexuality may be created by “accidental absences” (boarding schools)
	- heterosexuality is “natural”, though “homoerotic attraction” is a phenomenon that occurs in many animals
	- homosexuality is another variation in behavior
	- various myths related to inverts rejected and supposed
		- “mannish” female inverts have naturally large sexual organs; produces paroxysm
		- childlike faces
		- female: good whistlers
		- male: green garments
		- “all avocations are represented among invertss”
	- masturbation had poor side effects, especially for women
	- homoerotic sexual attraction caused by “accidental absences”, disappointment in opposite sex relationships, and same-sex seduction
	- requires “favourable organic predisposition”; congenital predisposition noted
		- “Interestingly, this passage prefigures the “nature versus nurture” debates that would become so important in academic circles throughout the 20th century: are complex behaviors and feelings, such as sexual attraction, biologically innate or the product of social influences or forces”
	- “no cure”  for inversion or homosexuality; no need to legislate against it
# Sigmund Freud
- theories on sexuality guided 20th century sexology and sex studies which followed historical sexology
- same cultural and intellectual grounds as early sexology
- “healthy” psychosexual development vs. “arrested development”
	- arrested development was normal; resolution of each psychosexual development stage was difficult to achieve successfully
- *Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality*, 1905: “polymorphous perversity” had to be morphed by society to create reproductive heterosexuality
	- natural orientation towards pleasure and erotic satisfaction
	- innate inversion was crude; had to be socially developed
	- separation of sexual practice from gender
	- common share that sex is natural
