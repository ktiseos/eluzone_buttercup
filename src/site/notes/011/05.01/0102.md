*The Strike Explained*, Third World Liberation Front. This pertains to the UCB strike

- “[…] the University as it is presently constituted is a white middle-class institution, and the education offered here reflect the cultural values of the white middle-class. […] They will have the group power, which a few individuals do not have, to resist the pressure to submit to a culture which is alien and basically hostile to them and the community they represent.”
	- “It will take intensive efforts and sacrifices on our part to enable Third World students to gain what schools in the ghettos and barrios have kept from them. If we do not accept this responsibility however, what we are really saying is that we accept the system of privilege which gives us access to elite jobs because we were born into middle class white families and condemns other to low paying and menial jobs.”
- “We have been conditioned to accept the violence and force used by the privileged class of this society but not the force with which oppressed peoples react. Yes, the strike <u>is</u> coercive but so much more is the normal, non-strike functioning of the University. To speak of the coercive aspects of the strike as immoral while at the same time silently acquiescing to the planned violence of the society and the University’s role in it, is in every sense hypocritical. […] To participate in the strike is, admittedly, to participate in an act of coercion but it is one very different from the coercion that made the demands necessary in the first place. […] If we are forced to use a strike, it is not out of choice but out of necessity in facing such a coercive society and university. One cannot in this kind of situation escape from the relative uses of coercion, because there is no middle ground.”
- “But whites are also victims of racism because it brings about a false perception of reality. This false perception of reality is in part created and reinforced by an education which distorts or omits the histories, experiences, contributions, and present conditions of TW people in this country. This is often done in a very subtle and perhaps unconcious way. TW students constantly notice it but white students rarely do. The establishment of a TW College, <u>which would be open to white students as well,</u> will help to perpetuate a more honest and fuller perception of reality by correcting the distortions and filling in the omissions about TW peoples which characterize so many courses in the university. This can be a major step toward eliminating the racism which makes victims of us all.”

# Ideology of Self-Determination
- structural and academic recognition of white deprivation of nonwhite education and selfhood
- recognition of individuals of TWLF demands, definition of studying
	- “How can one study in dignity one’s own culture, a culture filled with white denials of its peoplehood, within structures that continue these same denials.”
- serve needs of own community, not the interests of white and business community; benefit the oppressed
	- current and relevant curricula
	- “At this moment in history who can demand that academic consideration take precedence over the needs of the Third World communities? Moreover, whites do not have the right to make that choice. That choice must rather lie in the hands of those people for whom the choice is a question of survival, those people who are members of the Third World community.”
# Ideology of 3rd World Enrollment
- reject normal standards of admissions — standardized testing and grades
	- “How do you test a Third World person who refuses to believe the distorted education that he did receive?”
