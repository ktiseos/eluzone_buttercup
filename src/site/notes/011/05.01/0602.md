- one of the earliest orgs to advocate for ideas later addresseed by federal govt: suffrage, Indian preference, presing claims, public schools, and National Museum of American Indian Act (1989) → NM of AI in 2004
	- Brotherhood did not first advocate, but pushed for most of these; Indian prefeerence was original idea
- judged by Society of American Indians (threatened by organization)
	- abolishment vs. preservation of reservation system
	- well education and urban off-reservation lives vs poor, limited, reservation
	- 1911: favor for Americanized education and for self-independence
	- criticized from Dec. 1911–March 1913: “unscrupulous”, “offset”, “rival”, “notorious”
		- corruption before Brotherhood: land speculation, allotment and surrendering; Adams schemes
		- Perry Kennerly
		- ignored good people in Brotherhood (George Waters of Yakima, WWN)
- disliked by BIA before formation: rejected contract by Adams and Flathead Tribe (and Harve Phipps) in October
	- “Indians ‘have failed to learn and appreciate the value of property and money’”
- opposed by IRA: alliance with many SAI members
	- fear of secrecy; organization held no official record of meetings
-disliked by *Washington Post*, esp. representation
	- The editors of the Washington Post also opposed the Brotherhood, especially the idea that the Indians should have representation in Congress. If the American government allowed Indians to have this kind of political power, the Post surmised, then other groups--including the German-Americans, the Irish-Americans, and the Italian-Americans-would also want their own political representation.
