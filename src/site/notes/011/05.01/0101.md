*Third World Liberation Comes to San Francisco State and UC Berkeley*, Harvey Dong
# Involved Organizations
- ICSA: October 1967 → Chinatown poverty, teen tutorial, youth advocacy, socioeconomics, militancy, education towards community benefit
	- support from Philippine Americans for Collegiate Eneavor (PACE), est. 1967
		- low-income educational opportunities; 3rd world solidarity → humanism → 3rd world control
	- support from SFSC AAPA affiliate to Berkeley; JPAM
-  AAPA: “Asian American” collective; shared historical experience and solidarity along pan-ethnic lines
	- CN, PH, JP-AM demographic
		- prev. involvement in Civil Rights, Black Power, antiwar, farmworker union movements
		- 2nd-gen native-born, some foreign-born HK members
		- urban ASAM comms (Chinatown SF) or rural areas
		- common immigration exclusion and inst. racism: Vietnam War, Black Power, ASAM conditions
		- CSC (American born), Chinese Students Association (foreign born), NSC (2nd gen) AAPA leaders
		- Victoria Wong, 2nd gen CNAM from Salina
			- The first time you awaken is when you become politically aware. The second awakening is when you see all these Asian people talking the same way you are. This was the other part of my life which I always felt but could not yet identify […], why I felt a little bit different [being the only Asian] going to Black Panther Support Committee meetings. That's why the Yellow Symposium was important […] the very concept of political power for Asian Americans was not really expressed before. We were always treated like new immigrants even though some of us were actually fourth and fifth generation.
		- non-regionalism movement towards pan-ethnic
			- AAPA cultural demographic: Eng-speaking post-WWII baby boomers; 1.5/2nd-gen youth
			- desire for self-protection in mainstream society
## SFSUTWLF
- SFSUTWLF strike attended by UCBTWLF
	- model strike for UCB: direct mass action shutdown and forced acknowledgement by admin
	- followed MLK assassination and urban rebellion response; confrontational approach
	- response to unproductive negotiations, agreements, inc. police repression, low legal channels for social justice, failed negotiation with BSU, racism
- response: BSU → George Murray suspension on allegations as grad. student and instructor for 30 days, October 1968 → TWLF formation
- TWLF: BSU, Latin American Students Organization (LASO), Mexican American Student Confederation (MASC), ICSA, PACE, AAPA
	- “self-determination of third world peoples” principle; white students negligible in decision making, but high support and picket lines/arrests
## UCBTWLF
- peak conditions for protest
	- 1966 race/ethnic survey UCB: poor track record
	- 1.4% percent student body: Black + Chicano + NA
	- 26k students: 226 AFAM, 76 CH, 61 NA vs. 19% CA pop
	- sparse minority appointments to faculty; 1.8% faculty, 2 tenured Black faculty
	- misleading figure for ASAM; over representation
		- upper/middleclass students in ASAM vs enrollment from lower class or poor
		- meager rep for PHAM
		- intl studies for Asian Studies
		- no executive position ASAM
	- TWLF: reinforcements for African American students
		- In the view of the participants, third world solidarity was not an ideal but a necessity whose rationale would develop in process.
- Fall qtr 1968: AASU + ASAM/CHC forming TWLF; MASC questions of equal representation
	- NASU fourth group to join, formative, five members; formally inducted 1969 January
		- members were subject of relocation program and assimilation into mainstream
	- solidarity was influenced by revolutionary movements, Black Panther party in multiracial unity; SFSUTWLF 3rd world solidarity
		- however, first point was student grievances and lack of administration response
		- “Third world anticolonialism. Black Power, and Marxism were ideas that the activists developed to formulate a counter-hegemonic ideology among their ranks.”
	- white support → TWLF support committee
		- broad spectrum of radical left: Students for a Democratic Society, Independent Socialist Club, Young Socialist Alliance
- Winter quarter 1969: Asian Studies 100X: “The Asian Experience in America”
	- 6 graduate students + sponsor of Franz Schurmann, History, and Paul Takagi, Criminology

- **leading into revolution in late 60s**
	- Reagan government in CA; preparation towards presidential nomination, martial law
		- challenge against educational foundation and 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education (intelligence and standardized testing for fitness)

### SFSC after UCB
- three semesters
- acknowledgement of 3rd world frustrations and ethnic studies
	- distinction between inclusion vs. New Left ideologies: “The assumption here was that third world students were willing to work for reforms whereas many of the white students were members of leftist organizations whose goals did not include reforms.”
## Outcomes
- SFSC: first US school of ethnic studies: degrees for ethnic studies, American Indian, Asian American, Black, La Raza
- UCB: budget for department with subdivisions; stalemate
- training ground and learning tools for community activism
	- balancing act of bridging campus and community and legitimization on campur
	- uplifting of 3rd world student movement
- establishment of ethnic studies → 250+ ethnic studies programs in secondary and post-secondary
- modern UCB/SFSU: under/graduate programs for ethnic studies
- “Still, the most important but often forgotten legacy of the stakes was the building of solidarity among the different racial and ethnic groups that truly wished to change the educational environment. This solidarity found value in future struggles such as the International Hotel antieviction movement and the Alcatraz Island Native American movement, when many former TWLF participants were involved in struggles within their own ethnic communities but were linked in cooperation.”
