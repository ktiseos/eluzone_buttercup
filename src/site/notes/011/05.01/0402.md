- “the lines between "civilized" and "savage" expressive culture were stark for Burgess and Pratt, and both did what they could to burn those lines into the minds of their students”
- “The administrators who oversaw the schools viewed the practice of music in much the same way that most reservation superintendents did-in very stark, culturally and politically loaded terms. They believed that music lessons in the schools would combat the insidious influences of performative practices that predominated on reservations.”
- “The whole object of the school was to turn out loyal Americans. That was the object of the whole thing.”
- “edify local communities that the Native students who lived nearby were safely contained, free of any \[…] dangerous activities”
- “doubtless it \[vocal ability] will come in time, as it has with the Hawaiians and other peoples who have had longer contact with white influences;”
- “agreement with white codes of right and wrong and of mortality”
