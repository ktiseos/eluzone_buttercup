	- relocation hand in hand with termination
	- post-WW2 equivalent to annihilation and assimilation
- relocation and assimilation in both pre-and postwar tactics → reservation and allotmeent → annihilation through physical causes
	- “If they could not be destroyed, they must be turned into docile Christian tillers ofsoil. "And when an Indian learns to comply with one set ofrules and regulations, they are changed so that he is  compelled to  begin again,”
- 1950: 343k in 2-300 tribes
- Wyanddotte: 1850

- “termination "reflect­ed the conservative and nationalist mood of the Cold War era that resonated with the ideologies of individualism and capitalism."”
- 1977 report of termination cited multiple reasons:
	- well-off tribes did not need a special r/s to govt
	- relieve poverty through integration
	- mass disapproval of BIA
	- concern over ‘undefined law andd order’
	- desire to reclaim land
	- “reduce big government”
	- other concerns were over growing population followed birth rate increase (“not enough land”) and cost-economic reasoning + economic benefit of tax rolls/taxation
