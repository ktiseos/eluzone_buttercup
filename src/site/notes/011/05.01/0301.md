> [!quote] “In the days and years after the massacre, survivors probably felt the need to construct a narrative of compliance rather than de­fiance.”
- “Army officers' accounts noted that the two details confiscated domestic tools but gave greater emphasis to guns. Some gave particular attention to finding weapons beneath the bodies of Lakota women. Whitside testified that "the squaws [made] every effort to conceal [weapons], by hiding and sitting on them and in various other ways, evi[n]cing a most sullen mien." Captain Varnum offered strikingly specific details: "the first rifle I found was under a squaw who was moaning and was so indisposed to the search that I had her displaced, and under her was a beautiful Winchester rifle." He found another gun "under the skirts of a squaw, and we had to throw her on her back to get it." 8 Although another officer involved in the search, Lieutenant James D. Mann, claimed that when the soldiers found "squaws" concealing weapons, they "lifted them as tenderly and treated them as nicely as possible," Varnum's testimony undoubtedly comes closer to the truth and reveals a hostility toward the women that he and other officers continued to feel when they testified a week later. **This hostility is evident in their use of the word squaw, a term that invoked the racist stereotype of Indian women as ugly and degraded (an image that Varnum accentuated by reserving the description "beautiful" for the rifle). It also appears in Varnum's highly sex­ualized language (the first woman "moaning" atop a rifle, the second being thrown on her back), suggestive of a rape fantasy.**”
- depicting women as they did men via violence and rape; concealing weapons fantasy
- As people sought shelter in ravines and thickets of brush, artillery gunners pounded them with exploding shells. r7 As the Hotchkiss guns fired, Dewey Beard recalled, "there went up from these dying people a medley of death songs that would make the hardest heart weep."
- fighting back led to reduced casualty; retreat of Ling-Vannerus unit after losses, Oglalas allyship
- With the entire Seventh Cavalry imploring each other to avoid killing women and children, why did they so abysmally fail? To explain this, officers turned to a time-honored argument, in the words of Captain Edward S. Godfrey: "we could not discern the distinction between bucks and squaws."
