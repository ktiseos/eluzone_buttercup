concept of plant blindness
# plants carry importance via
- agriculture/consumption
	- basis of all food chains → primary producers
	- primary producers photosynthesize solar heat/energy into chemical energy as sugar
	- primary producers include many algae and bacteria
- sheltering (material culture)
	- shelter via wood
	- generally things are made out of materials derived from wood or other plants
- medicinal
	- plant-based medicines (aspirin originated from willow plants)
	- different chemicals used than those in food/consumption (sugar, starch, proteins vs.)
	- consumption chemicals are primary chemicals
	- medicine, toxins, and flavors are secondary chemicals and not part of major biosynthetic pathways
		- cinnamons, basil compounds
- ecosystem services: purification, water estuaries, erosion prevention, etc.
	- services which provide a monetary/chargeable value
	- global warming and prevention of global warming
		- use of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis and removing it from the overall ecosystem
# phylogenetic review
- plants and algae are primary producers; fungi are decomposers
- monophyletic groups/clades
- biological classification system:
	1. domain
	2. kingdom
	3. phylum
	4. class
	5. order
	6. family
	7. genus
	8. species
- maintained due to some reasons such as endangered species act (unable to remove the species definition)
- species: an evolutionary lineage/line
	- biological species definition: a species is reproductively isolated and only is able to reproduce with its species and not other groups/species
	- plants falter under the biological species definition; plants can often produce fertile hybrid offspring (vs. sterile hybrid offspring in animals)
		- hybrid swarms can occur
		- hybrids can back-breed
	- bacteria cannot breed sexually
	- main definition is on an evolutionary line; vaguer definition here
# land plants
- four informal groups of land plants
- overarching plant groups: nonvascular and vascular plants
	- non-vascular: bryophytes
		- liverworts, mosses, hornworts
	- vascular has two subgroups
		- seedless vascular plants
			- lycophtes (club mosses, spikemosses, quillworts)
			- monilophytes (ferns, horsetails, whisk ferns)
		- seeded plants
			- gymnosperms and angiosperms
			- angiosperms are flowering plants and the most familiar often
- non-vascular plants are tiny and lack vascular tissues (“plumbing systems”, veins, water/sugar/mineral transport systems)
	- limited and small
	- live in wet areas; sperm must flow through water and moist areas (flagella)
- seedless vascular plants have a water transport system but do not reproduce via seeds
	- reproduce using spores
	- live in wet areas; sperm must flow through water and moist areas (flagella)
- seed plants do not need to be restricted to moist/wet areas
	- seeds have embryos and sperm + food package and covering
	- seeds lack flagella and do not need to swim
	- often evolutionary advantageous
- gymnosperms: “naked seed plants”
	- gymno- refers to “being naked”
	- seeds are not enclosed in fruit or larger coverings; seeds are exposed
- angiosperms: flowering plants
	- angio- refers to “container”
	- fruit is the vessel/container
	- both flowers and seeds are present in fruits
# angiosperm morphology
- flowering plant form
- morphology is the study of form
## non-reproductive morphology
- composed of 3 primary plant organs
- roots usually grounded/underground
	- forms a root system to absorb water and minerals
		- including common nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium
	- anchors the plant and keeps it in place
- above-ground organs include leaves and stems
- leaves have two specific components
	- blade: flat, expansive section
	- petiole: thin, skinny “stem”
	- primarily used in photosynthesis
- stems
	- hold up leaves and often make leaves or part of what we think makes up leaves
	- several regions
		- leaves attach at the stem nodes
		- internodes are sections between nodes/leaf nodes
- leaves and stems make up the shoot system
	- the end of the plant opposite of the roots: “shoot tip” or “terminal bud”
	- axil: the angle of the region between a leaf and the stem
	- axillary/apical bud: the bud structure present at the axil
		- growing points with a specific arrangement
- simple vs compound leaves
	- depends on the subdivision of the blade into leaflets
	- in both there is not the presence of multiple axillary buds; only at the base of the leaf
- phenotypic/developmental plasticity
	- leaves may differ in form due to their environment, temperature, function, amount of sunlight received, etc. even though they have the same genes
	- organs may be modified (onion leaves/stems)
- stems are necessary organs for the plant
	- stems can be green, photosynthetic, underground, etc.
	- not the normal function, but is possible
### meristems
- a group of cells usually undifferentiated (or deemed separate types of cells) that can perform cell division
- equivalent of stem cells; no stem cells in plants
- growing regions of plants
- two kinds of **meristems**
	- **apical meristems** are always present; must exist for a plant to exist
		- exists in all buds, root tips
		- lengthen plants; increase height/depth
		- tissue formed is primary tissue or the primary plant body
	- **lateral meristem** are not always present, but optional; two subtypes
		- cylindrical, not pointed
		- occur on the sides of the plant
		- create secondary tissues or a secondary plant body
		- widen the plant; diameter
		- found in large trees
		- many types of plants, such as wood, cork, etc.
		- woody plants are hard due to wood tissue
- dome of undifferentiated cells underneath horns
### common terms
- **herb**: any non-woody plant
- wood: tissue that transports water and minerals up and down plant
	- **xylem** tissue
	- secondary
- woody plants include **trees and shrubs**
	- trees have one main stem (the trunk) and are usually larger than shrubs
	- shrubs have several main stems rather than one big stem; shrub stems branch out from one group/point
### growth in plants vs. animals
- meristems cause **indeterminate** growth
- indeterminate: no fixed size; infinite growth only limited by resources/supplies
- animal growth is determinate; fixed by number of stem cells
- differences in growth form
	- animals have fixed amounts of growth; unitary body plans (some exceptions)
	- plants have **modulary body plans**; indeterminate
## reproductive physiology
### flowers
- **modified determinate shoot stems and leaves**
- modified via evolution
- four flower parts: sepals, petals, stamen, pistil
- **sepal**: lowest node, usually multiple (3+) on one node
	- protects flower whilst in the bud
- **petal**: usually colored to attract pollinators, but not always; also usually large
	- exist in wind pollination plants, but less showy
- **stamen**: produces pollen grains which carry sperm
	- the top part usually produces → ??? ; lower stem is filament
- **pistil**: sexual organs
	- carpels are modified leaves which make up the pistil; fused together
	- **ovary** on top of the carpels; produces ovules which carry eggs
	- long connecting part called the **style**
	- **stigma** is sticky/feathery; catches pollen grains
		- pollen grains grow a long tube through the style into the ovary in attempt to cause fertilization
- fertilized zygotes develop into embryos; ovules grow into seeds
### monocot/eudicot
- eu- → “true”; revision of dicot polyphyletic clade
- primary classes
- named by the number of cotyledons (seed leaves)
	- cotyledon: a leaf on the embryo of the seed
	- monocots have one cotyledon, eudicots have two
- can also be differentiated by veins
	- monocot veins are parallel, eudicots are netted; very small, usually noticed more under light
- different organizations of stem/shoot vascular tissue
	- complex arrangement of monocots
	- eudicot tissue arranged in a ring
- different root systems
	- monocots have a fibrous root system
	- eudicots have a taproot system; one tap root and lateral roots
- different numbers of flower parts; standardize across clades
	- monocots: in threes
	- eudicots: in fours or fives
## plant cells
- plastids: bound by 2 membranes outside
	- chloroplasts: 4-6 um in diameter
		- perform photosynthesis
		- disc-shaped, but are able to change shapes and orientation with regard to the cell membrane
		- thylakoid membrane sacs interconnected and stacked
		- granum/grana stack in thylakoid
		- stroma fluid
		- semi-autonomous; able to divide via binary fission, have nucleoid with several copies of chromosome, and regulated via dual control
	- chromoplast: a colored, but non-green plastid
		- usually yellow, orange, or red → carotenoids
		- carotenoids are fat soluble, not water soluble; stored in the thylakoids
		- found in fruits mostly, also flowers
	- leukoplasts: white/clear plastids
		- store starch or oil
	- amyloplasts: clear plastids
		- store starch
	- all plastids are developmentally related to each other
		- all plastids start out as proplastids then differentiate
		- chloroplasts aboveground, chromoplast belowground, etc.
		- mature chloroplasts can convert to chromoplasts and vice versa
- central vacuole
	- bound by one membrane: tonoplast
	- large; small vacuoles merge into one central vacuole which occupies up to 95% cell volume
	- contains cell sap made of water, sugars, ions, salts, water-soluble pigments, toxins, enzymes, etc.; many solutes
	- many functions; perform enzymatic/digestive role instead of lysosomes (subsume in central vacuole and digest)
		- store pigments as long as they are water-soluble; anthocyanins (red, blue, “nice flower colors”)
		- store toxins; avoids keeping it in cytosol and damaging organelles
		- stores crystals; sometimes toxins crystallize due to volume
		- facilitate growth; maintain turgor/water pressure
			- keeps erect/rigidity of cell walls
## cell walls
- cell walls: in the apoplast
	- protoplast: the cell membrane and structures inside the membrane
		- aka symplast
	- apoplast: all sections outside the cell membrane: cell walls, spaces between the cells, and spaces inside dead cells
	- share an extracellular matrix like animal cells; may be more rigid/supportive
	- different functions: helps maintain shape and turgor pressure
		- protects from predators and viruses
		- many allow transport through the cell wall
		- enzymes are embedded in cell wall
	- several layers of the cell wall
- a **minimum of two layers**
	- **middle lamella**: a glue-like more outermost layer
		- lamella → “layer”
		- hydrophilic
		- made from **pectins**
			- causes the structure of jams/jellies
			- pectin makes cells stick together
			- hydrophilic
		- made of polysaccharides; no cellulose
	- **primary cell wall**: a layer within the middle lamella
		- not rigid, but contains cellulose
		- specific arrangement of **cellulose**
		- composed in a matrix which includes other materials; cellulose is embedded in the matrix
			- cellulose: beta glucose subunits (the hydroxyl on the first unit of the ring is parallel to the ch2oh unit)
				- beta glucose subunits are attached together while hydroxyl-ch2oh parallels are opposite of the adjacent units
				- linear repeating chain; not coiled; strong; composed of 1000s of beta glucose units
				- glucose molecule
				- not the basis of the cell wall alone; large amounts exist in parallel and form hydrogen bonds between themselves creating a cellulose molecule “cable”
					- **cables form cellulose microfibrils; basis of the cell wall**
			- matrix has two main components: pectins (polysaccharides) and hemicellulose
				- both are polysaccharides
				- both are hydrophilic
				- water will go through the primary cell wall and the middle lamella without transport channel usage
				- pectins form a mesh/net; some but irregular hydrogen bonding between pectins
				- hemicellulose crosslinks; tethers together cellulose microfibrils by forming hydrogen bonds across one length of a microfibril then traveling across to form bonds to the other microfibril
					- always runs parallel to the cellulose microfibrils
				- proposed correct layout
				- glycoproteins, waterproofing materials, lignin can all also be in the matrix, but are not necessary
	- additional cell walls are further in
	- **secondary cell wall** is within the primary cell wall
		- can be much thicker than previous two layers
		- often when a cell has deposited this, it will die
		- rigid, hydrophobic wall; needs channels for transport
		- cellulose microfibrils; several parallel layers arranged in different orientations; cross-netting
		- matrix made of many materials: hemicellulose, **lignin**
			- lignin is a phenolic polymer which reinforces the rigidity/hydrophobic properties of the secondary cell wall
				- aromatic ring with a hydroxyl; no repeated linkage between lignin
		- secondary cell wall prevents growth
- cellulose microfibrils are particularly arranged in order to facilitate cell expansion
	- microfibrils cannot be stretched; hemicellulose crosslinks must be broken and turgor pressure will expand microfibrils and cells within
	- elongation; more microfibrils can be created afterwards
	- in random arrangement, cells expand in all random directions
## plasmodesmata
- plasmodesma: a cytoplasmatic connection between two cells that facilitates communication
- lumen: the inside of the cell
- cell membrane between neighboring cells is continuous
- endoplasmic reticulum has a portion of the reticulum form a membrane channel and connect into and through the neighboring cell
	- inner tubule is the desmotubule
- channels are very small
- grouped into a primary pit field: group of plasmodesmata
## pits
- areas that lack the secondary cell wall after it has been deposited; a hole in the secondary cell wall
- pits occupy a primary pit field; avoids blocking off primary pit fields immediately
- created after a cell membrane has usually died off
# cell types, tissues, and tissue systems
- cell: basic unit of life
- tissue: a group of cells which forms a structural unit
- simple tissue: 1 cell type; complex: 2+
- tissue system: a group of tissues which form a structural unit
- three tissue systems in vascular plants
	- dermal tissue system: the external outer covering
		- epidermis tissue in primary growth
		- in herbs, one single continuous tissue represents the epidermis tissue
		- covers everything except meristems
	- vascular tissue system
		- xylem transport system (for water and minerals)
		- phloem transport system (for sugars produced by photosynthesis)
		- veins in stem and root
	- ground tissue system
		- a tissue system between the vascular and dermal tissue
		- everything else not in the dermal and vascular tissue system
## dermal tissue system
### epidermis tissue in primary growth
- represented as a continuous layer on both above and underground growth
- does not represent the meristems
- functions vary on location of epidermis tissue
	- common function: protection against viruses and bacterial infection
	- protects against water loss above ground (waxes)
	- allows permeability for water underground
	- **photosynthesis is not a function of epidermis** (production of sugars)
- complex tissue with differences between monocots and eudicots
	- monocot stem: cells are arranged in linear, staggered rows; normal epidermal cells
		- these resemble typical ones drawn from an elodea leaf
		- no air space between monocot cells
	- eudicot stem: puzzle piece, freeform
		- no air space between eudicot cells
		- normal epidermal cells
	- both of the above cells are aboveground normal epidermal cells; only one type
		- both are covered by cuticle layer made from cutin and wax
		- ridged cuticle which prevents water loss
	- another type: guard cells
		- always occur in pairs
		- may be covered with pores
		- 2 guard cells and a pore form a stoma
			- pore allows for gas exchange
		- if no pore exists between guard cells, gas exchange is prohibited
		- guard cells are more elongated in monocots than eudicots, but they perform the same functions
		- guard cells are surrounded by normal epidermal cells
		- **only epidermal tissue cell which has chloroplasts**
			- make sugars, but are used to control stomata openings
		- much smaller than normal cells
	- another type: trichomes
		- a type of hair for plant cells
		- various appearances and various functions
			- water vessels, hairs, branched hairs, scales, etc.
			- unicellular – papillae, water vesicles, hairs
			- multicellular – hairs, branches, pelltate scales, glands
		- may be much larger than guard and normal, especially if protective
	- another type: glandular cells
		- secrete material, usually a protective material (insect repellent)
		- typically a type of trichome, so these are actually often glandular trichomes
		- flatter, sac-like trichomes
	- another type: subsidiary cells
		- adjacent to guard cells and aid function of guard cells
- single layer of cells
## vascular tissue system
- vascular bundles surrounded by the ground tissues
- ring shape around the stem center
### xylem
- complex tissue which transports water and minerals
- three cell types: water-conducting cells, parenchyma, sclerenchyma fibers
- xylem water-conducting cells last for many years due to secondary cell walls
- water conducting cells: dead, hollowed-out, elongate cells; thick walls (2* cw), with easy flow through cell for water
	- two types of wcc found in angiosperms, and can be found either in any angiosperms
		- most gymnosperms and non-vascular plants only have tracheids
	- tracheids and vessel elements
	- water mostly moves up the plant (sometimes lateral)
	- begin as live cells; end walls are degraded, removing organelles and primary cell wall
- tracheids: long, thin cells which taper at the ends
	- several pits across the elongate
	- in tracheids, water zig-zags through the pits of each cell; pit pairs line up to connect between tracheids
	- “pit membrane” between the pit pairs: actually the primary cell wall and middle lamella sandwiched and thinned down between the tracheids
	- pit membranes prevent embolisms from traveling through conduits/pits and destroying tracheids like vessels
- vessel elements
	- stacks form a vessel; a pipe that carries the water; 30-50 stacked, sometimes as small as 2 stacked
	- shorter and wider than tracheids
	- pits found on the lateral walls, the side walls, and the end walls; no tapering
	- end walls have openings/perforations: perforation plate
		- large, flat or slanted opening that goes through all of the wall layers; water enters through the middle
		- perforation plate may have several smaller openings surrounded by wall material, creating possible resistance; grate-like
		- one large hole: simple perforation plate
		- grate: compound perforation plate
	- simple perforation plates are more efficient than compound perforation plate; both are more efficient than tracheids
	- possible to have massive embolisms: vessels are wholly destroyed
- above found in secondary xylem: lateral meristems and non-elongate, fully mature primary xylem; full complete rigid secondary walls
### primary xylem
- protoxylem and metaxylem
- both are for immature, elongate cells
- protoxylem is the earliest xylem found in maturing plants/xylem
	- very stretchable
	- will have rings of secondary cell wall or helices (helix/spiral)
	- when protoxylem stretches, more space between cell wall, but does not rupture
- metaxylem occurs later
	- network/reticulum of intersecting cell wall as added
	- or complete 2 cell wall with pits and possibly perforations
	- less stretchable; still alive
### phloem
- “information highway”; transfers sugars, rna, and some hormones in any direction across the plant
- contents are placed under positive pressure; rupture would emit materials
- complex tissue
	- sieve-tube elements
		- only one sugar-conducting cell type is seen in angiosperms
	- companion cells
	- parenchyma
	- sclerenchyma fibers
- sieve tube elements
	- alive when functioning even though they have protoplasts
	- no secondary walls; soft, only primary and middle lamella
	- can be damaged; last only 1 year on average
	- have pores: enlarged plasmodesmata
		- used as connections between cells
		- connected/clustered in sieve areas
		- sides of walls/cells
	- very small cells
	- end walls → sieve plates
		- have sieve walls on the end plates
		- flat walls contain simple sieve-plates with a single sieve area
		- slanted walls contain compound sieve-plates with multiple sieve areas
	- 30-40 stacked
	- may look like vessel elements in diagrams
	- stack on top of each other
### callose
- polysaccharide made from glucose (beta 1-3 linkages vs. cellulose and starch)
- lines the top and bottom of pores; doesnt overlap
- stains blue, recognizable
- **definitive callose** appears at the end of the cell’s life to block off full sieve plate preventing sugar from  falling out
- wound callose eventually becomes definitive
### p-proteins
- only in eudicots
- p-protein bodies; distinctive bodies in the cytoplasm
- hydrate to become slime; gooey, hydrated
- lines side of elements
- quick response for cell wounds/damage
- slime plug
### modified protoplasm
- no tonoplast; no central vacuole to impede movement
	- no cytoskeleton, no nucleus, no ribosomes
	- contents of sieve tube elements can go through room in center easily
	- remaining tonoplast lines edges of cells, such as er
	- some mitochondria in cell
### companion cells
- developmentally related to sieve tube elements; elements are paired with companion cells
- mother cell unequally divides into sieve tube element and a small companion cell sliver cut off from mother cell
- aids in metabolism; many more mitochondria and ribosomes in companion cells to aid
- especially helps put sugars into sieve tube elements: “phloem loading”
- soft tissue, easily damaged
## ground tissue system
- everything inside and around the vascular tissue system
- center region of stem: “pith” region
- outer region between epidermis and vascular ring: “cortex” region
- intervals in vascular region: “pith ray” region
- ground tissue system is in these regions and others
- involves 3 simple tissues
### parenchyma tissue
- singular cell type: parenchyma cells
- ubiquitous with the exception of the epidermis
- most common tissue in a plant
-  all cells in parenchyma are alive
- majority of parenchyma cells are **isodiametric**: cubical in nature, but not necessarily square
	- some are elongated/long and thin, but not all
- only the primary cell wall and the middle lamella are present in parenchyma tissues
	- thin cell wall
- primarily functions for photosynthesis (found in leaves) or metabolism ie cell respiration (roots), storage, contributing to growth, reversion to meristematic state
	- meristematic state: begins dividing again in order to repair wounds
- air space between parenchyma cells; 25 um
	- necessary for gas exchange
- no chloroplasts; too deep within the leaf to pick up light
### collenchyma
- found at the edges/periphery of organs; closer to but not necessarily next to the epidermis
- found in bundles and layers
- all cells in collenchyma are alive
- collenchyma cells elongate over maturity
- only the primary cell wall and the middle lamella are present in collenchyma tissues
	- lots of pectin in the cell wall; may make it look glossy
	- some regions of the cell wall are thick, and some are thin; irregularly thickened
	- distinctive irregularity
		- thick cell walls support the collenchyma
- functions primarily to support growing regions; elongates/stretches as the organ grows and stretches
	- not a lot of support, but is some support
- known as the collenchyma strands found in celery strings
### sclerenchyma
- found in many locations; its main locations vary
- all cells in sclerenchyma are dead at maturity
- 2 different cell shapes with specific names
	- fibers: long and thin; very small, empty lumen surrounded by a thick cell wall; like a very bad straw/tube
		- majority is secondary cell wall filled in, with a thin primary cell wall
	- sclereids: various shapes as long as not long and thin; star-shaped, spherical, etc.
		- also have a small lumen and thick cell walls
		- shapes may be for protection (hurt to bite down on star-shaped)
	- cells have secondary cell walls, primary cell walls, and middle lamella
			- lignin present; makes cells rigid and adds support
			- regular, even thickness of cell walls
### other notes
- transfer cells: a variation of parenchyma
	- cell walls protrude in projections; cell membrane increases, so ability to transport increases
- stone cells: a variation of sclereid schlerenchyma cells
	- roughly spherical; sclerified secondary cell walls feel stone-like, gritty (seen in pears)
	- 5 um
# development
- totipotency: all well; one cell, if treated via tissue culture, would be able to divide and form a full organism
	- with parenchyma; could be done with collenchyma but would have to remove wall
	- vs. stem cells
	- genes for all different plant cells are present in the parenchyma cell
- three overlapping processes; hard to distinguish
	- growth: an increase in size
		- cell division: mitosis → more cells → enlarge
		- cell enlargement: huge process in plants vs animals; plants have a central vacuole that makes it easier to enlarge by absorbing water vs. making large amounts of cytoplasm
	- morphogenesis
		- generating a form
		- used to believe was mostly due to the plane of cell division’ anticlinal (perpendicular) cell division or periclinal (parallel)
			- is important specifically when an uneven/asymmetrical division occurs
			- is important when generating plant polarity
			- is important in first zygotic cell division (plant polarity)
		- cell enlargement; enlarge parallel to organ
	- cell differentiation
		- specialization
		- compare to animal cells; animal cells have cell lineages and develop into specific cells based on their precursor; plants develop based on relative position to the rest of the plant (and thus the hormones adjacent to it in the plant)
		- “pattern formation”
		- differential gene expression
- meristem cells are known as initials
	- in first division, the plane matters; it forms an initial and derivative
	- in second division, plane is hopefully the same; one initial, three derivatives
	- meristems are not fully meristematic; as derivative cells divide, they lose the ability to divide and become progressively more differentiated; vs. the initial cell
		- some cells may divide longer than others; gradual process
	- three primary meristems for each tissue system
		- protoderm: surface level meristem; used for dermal tissue system
		- procambium: strands found inside the stem; vascular tissue system
		- ground meristem: ground tissue system
- phase change: juvenile leaves differ from adult leaves
	- flowers: flowers are modified determinate leaves
- current hypothesis of flower phase change; switching from vegetative growth to flowering growth
	- the meristem must change from a vegetative meristem to a floral meristem
		- meristem identity genes produce transcription factors which change identity of meristem
	- abc hypothesis
		- sepal > petal > stamen > carpel
		- three sets of genes: a, b, c genes
		- each set of genes is active in two roles/worlds
			- a: sepal and petal
			- b: petal and stamen
			- c: stamen and carpel
		- the activity of genes and mutations in these genes affects what parts of the flowers are produced
			- cultivated vs wild rose gene activity
# leaves
# photorespiratory processes
- standard photosynthesis occurs in C3 plants: first product of carbon fixation is a 3 carbon molecule
- in xeric environments, first product of carbon fixation is a 4 carbon molecule, disrupting calvin cycle
	- c4 plants
	- cam plants
- both c4 and cam have pep carboxylase (phophoenolpyruvate) which can only add co2 to pep; forms oxaloacetate (4c)
- in non-hot temperatures, c3 plant does better
- in darker/less intense light intensities, c3 plant does better
- photorespiration occurs due to buildup of o2 while stomata is closed to prevent dehydration/death from remaining open in xeric environments
	- rubp will catalyze with both co2 and o2; o2 will create one 3-phophoglycerate and one 2-phosphoglycolate which is broken down and released as co2
## calvin cycle
- 400 to 500g h2o per gram of co2 for c3
	- poor efficiency; tend to be in areas where water is abundant
	- high use of co2
- light reaction: absorbs light, and water is split for electrons in electron transport chain; photosystems produce oxygen (o2) and atp and nadph in stroma
- calvin cycle
	- RuBisco catalyzes carbon fixation
		- ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase
		- slow and large enzyme; common; huge amount of protein
	- 3Rubp → (3CO2) → 6PGA
		- 3 rubp: ribulose bisphosphate
		- 3 co2 is fixated to 3rubp; forms unstable carbon molecules which form 6 3cs (3-phosphoglycerate/3pga)
		- fixation: adding inorganic carbon to organic molecule
		- PGA: 3C with a COOH, OH, CH2OP group
	- 6PGA → (6ATP) (6NADPH) → 6G3P
		- G3P: Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate
			- COH group instead of COOH
		- reduction; energy from sunlight added; G3P is the sugar createed
		- 1 g3p siphoned off for sugar production, starch, etc.
	- 5G3P → (3ATP) → 3RuBP
		- regenerate RuBP
## c4 plants
- sugarcane, bermuda grass, zea mays, amaranthus, purslane
- evolved at least 45 times and in 19 different families (3 monocot, 16 eudicot)
- kranz anatomy: “wreath”; enlarged bundle sheath cells around the vein; puffy looking; altered chloroplast; and mesophyll cells are wrapped around bundle sheath
	- initial carbon fixation occurs in the mesophyll cells
	- calvin cycle occurs in the bundle sheath cells
	- the processes are separated across location/spatially separate
- mesophyll chloroplasts have large amounts of thylakoids (light reactions) and linear + cyclic electric flow → high oxygen flow; no rubisco
- bundle sheath cell chloroplasts have low oxygen/airspace, have rubisco, and don’t have many thylakoids; thylakoids only have cyclic electric flow, so no rubisco made
- in mesophyll: co2 is picked up with pep carboxylase enzyme → catalyzes addition to produce oxaloacetate 4c → converts into other 4cs (aspartate, malate)
- in bundle: move to bundle, break off co2, and produce carbon cycle; co2 breakage forms pyruvate
- move back to mesophyll: pyruvate is converted with atp to form phosphoenol pyruvate
- uses more atp via this process
- uses 250-300g h2o per gram of co2
## cam plants
- initial carbon fixation occurs at night; calvin cycle occurs at day
- agave, orchids, pineapples cacti and succulents; stonecrop, crassulaceae, kalanchoe
	- orchids and agaves — monocots
	- very hot and dry environments; xeric
		- opening stomata would dehydrate/kill
- Crassulacean Acid Metabolism
	- named after crassulaceae family (stonecrop/kalanchoe lilies)
	- stomata only open at night to collect co2; gas exchange
	- pep carboxylase in cytosol catalyzes co2 to pep forming 4c oxaloacetate
	- converts to **malic acid** and stored in central vacuole; accumulated overnight
		- sour in morning; high acidity
	- stomata close in day
	- malic acid is taken out of vacuole, co2 broken off and produces calvin cycle sugars
		- light rxns only in day
	- pyruvate forms; use atp to convert into phosphoenol pyruvate
- uses 50-100g h2o per gram of co2
# sun vs. shade leaves in c3
- phenotypic plasticity
- how much sun is in location where leaf develops
- thicker leaf is in sun, thinner in shade; even if they have same volume
# roots
- primarily for anchoring and absorbing minerals
	- modified sometimes
		- storage (carrot taproots, manioc, sweet potato)
		- prop roots (corn) hold plant up
		- buttress roots
		- strangler fig roots; dispersed roots growing and sending roots down, surround main tree
		- pneumatophores: living cells, gas exchange (black mangroves)
		- aerial roots/epiphytic: epiphytic orchids; upwards/canopy roots
- anatomy of primary growth
	- root cap protecting the apical meristem; produced by the apical meristem
		- sheds over time/sloughs off
		- makes mucigel: hydrated polysaccharide; slimy; secretes into soil; creates a region of soil next to the root different from that further away — **rhizosphere** (rhizome)
			- different bacteria, microbes
		- cell division zone
			- quiescent zone in apical meristem
			- generates pattern; contributes cells to rest of root, but very slowly (~15 days)
		- cell elongation zone
		- cell maturation zone
			- root hair: extension of one epidermal cell
				- increases surface area for absorption
				- 70-90% of actual absorption
				- temporary; only lasts ~1 week and more root hairs are produced
				- root hairs necessary for specialization, but also because only place for root hair safely; avoids elongating cells destroying root; higher up is at branch roots
- root has primary structures/tissues
	- epidermis with a thin or no cuticle, root hairs, and no stomata
	- large, thick cortex
		- standard normal parenchyma cells but also endodermis length
		- both part of cortex
		- ground meristems
	- vascular cinder/stele
		- procambium
		- vascular tissue
- endodermis
	- screens what passes into the vascular cylinder/tissue
	- thickened/transverse/stained walls:
	- no air space between endodermis
	- casparian strip
		- suberin: waterproof, lipid, fat
		- could also be lignin (phenolic)
		- anticlinal walls (perpendicular) fully permeated by casparian strip
		- binds to cell membrane
		- forces solutions to cross cell membrane to regulate vascular tissue
	- passage cells
- different routes through endodermis
	- apoplastic route: materials enter through cell wall and spaces in cell wall
	- symplastic: materials travel across membrane early and go through cytosol through cells
	- transmembrane: across cytosol and membrane of cells
- vascular cylinder in eudicots
	- pericycle: one layer of cells; parenchyma cells
		- lateral roots originate in pericycle while meristematic and bridging out
		- secondary growth
	- move into primary phloem (outside) and primary xylem (inside)
		- has protoxylem and metaxylem
			- protoxylem: poles that radiate outward
			- metaxylem: everything else inside
			- number of protoxylem poles varies; 2 minimum; 2–~6
				- can change over time/developmentally
	- single layer of residual procambium between phloem and xylem if secondary growth is possible
- vascular cylinder in monocots
	- central pith; monocot stems don’t have a pith but roots do, vice versa on eudicots; pith instead of central metaxylem
	- primary xylem surrounds pith in uneven rows/poles
	- many protoxylem poles
	- metaxylem around pith
	- patches of primary phloem outside
	- one layer of pericycle
