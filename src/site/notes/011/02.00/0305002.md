# Ecosystems
- An ecosystem has a **biotic** unit and an **abiotic** unit; living vs. non-living
	- **Biotic:** organisms, community, prey/food
	- **Abiotic:** oxygen, nutrients, water (and the availability of all of these units)
- **Limiting factors:** the combination of biotic and abiotic factors which can check the size of a population
- An ecosystem is **divided into:**
	- **Producers/Autotrophs:** Plants and cyanobacteria
	- **Consumers:** Animals
	- **Decomposers:** Bacteria, fungi, microorganisms
- Ecosystems contain **complexity** through species **stability** and <u></u>**carrying capacity**
	- **Carrying Capacity:** the maximum population that an ecosystem can support in the long term
		- Carrying capacity is never in <u>stasis</u>, but fluctuates around a given average depending on environmental factors
	- **Stability** prevents extinction and population die-offs; instability is induced by reducing attachments to a greater food web
## Producers
- **Autotrophic processes: Photosynthesis and Chemosynthesis**
	- **Photosynthesis** converts sunlight energy into chemical energy; carbon dioxide → oxygen, and light energy → sugars (glucose); plants and cyanobacteria
	- **Chemosynthesis** converts chemicals (sulfur) into carbon compounds; bacteria
- Producers undergo cellular  respiration, but use less glucose and oxygen than they photo/chemosynthesize
- **Gross Primary Productivity (GPP):** the total amount of energy converted from an inorganic form to an organic form
	- **Net Primary Productivity (NPP):** the amount of organic energy remaining after part of the gross primary productivity is consumed by producers to survive
		- Net productivity is determined via biomass and cells (in units of g/m^2 per year)
		- **Tropical rainforests, marshland/estuaries, & coral reefs have the highest productivity** at 2,500 g/m^2
		- **Temperate evergreens** follow at 1,300 g/m^2
		- **Woodlands** at 700 g/m^2
		- **Cultivated land** is around 650, but can value much higher
		- **Deserts** lowest at 90 g/m^2
## Consumers and Decomposers
- Both are **heterotrophs**
	- Consumers, Detritivores, and Decomposers
- **Sole heterotrophic process: cellular respiration**
- Food web; *primary, secondary, tertiary consumers*, etc.
## Energy Transfer Efficiency
- Only 10% of the total energy is net transferred across each trophic level; all of the energy is consumed, but the 90% excluded is burned in order to consume prey and maintain processes to stay alive
- This net transfer/loss includes energy obtained by decomposers

## Ecosystem Cycles
- various methods of **nutrient cycling**
### Carbon Cycle
- primarily in the form of a gas, CO2
---
1. CO2 is used in **photosynthesis** by producers and converted
2. Heterotrophs **consume** organic forms of energy which were made from CO2
3. Heterotrophs perform **cellular respiration**, releasing CO2
### Nitrogen Cycle
- Nitrogen is the basis of proteins and DNA (nucleic acid)
- 78% of the atmosphere is stable nitrogen gas; difficult to break apart
- Nitrogen-fixing bacteria converts nitrogen into ammonia
	- Prominently performed by cyanobacteria
	- Nitrifying bacteria in soil
- Algae blooms in excess nitrogen
---
1. **Nitrogen gas is converted by bacteria** to solid ammonia
2. Ammonia is **biologically assimilated** into bacteria
3. Bacteria undergoes **decomposition**
- **Two outcomes:**
	1. Decomposed ammonia is **taken in by plants**/cycled
	2. Or ammonia is **denitrified**; converts back into nitrogen gas
		- Denitrifying bacteria
### Phosphate/Phosphorus cycle
- Phosphorus: nutrient in the soil, uptake by plants, use in animal skeletons, genetic material, ATP
---
1. Phosphorus is used in **photosynthesis** by producers and converted into glucose
2. Heterotrophs **consume** glucose
3. Heterotrophs release phosphorus via **cell respiration and decomposition**
### Water/Hydrologic Cycle
- Not a nutrient, but a major component (photosynthesis)
- Complex; ground, surface, plant components involved
- A system of flows and stores
---
1. **Evaporation** off of a body of water/source; sunlight/heat energy converts into vapor
	- *Evapotranspiration* in plants → evaporation
2. Vapor rises through altitude levels and cools; water molecules are dense; **condensate**, bind, and attract via polarity; reduces surface space
3. Cloud mass forms and cools; water droplets are pulled by gravity → **precipitation** as rain, hail, sleet, snow
- **Multiple outcomes:**
	- Plant uptake; water loss becomes **transpiration**
	- **Surface runoff** on hardscape or oversaturated surfaces
	- **Infiltration** into ground → groundwater
