# ecosystems
- an ecosystem has a biotic unit and an abiotic unit; living vs. non-living
	- **biotic:** organisms, community, prey/food
	- **abiotic:** oxygen, nutrients, water (and availability of all)
- **limiting factors:** biotic and abiotic factors which can check the size of a population
- ecosystem is **divided into:**
	- **producers/autotrophs:** plants and cyanobacteria
	- **consumers:** animals
	- **decomposers:** bacteria, fungi, microorganisms
## producers
- **autotrophic processes: photosynthesis and chemosynthesis**
	- photosynthesis converts sunlight energy into chemical energy; carbon dioxide → oxygen, and light energy → sugars (glucose); plants and cyanobacteria
	- chemosynthesis converts chemicals (sulfur) into carbon compounds; bacteria
- producers undergo cellular  respiration, but use less glucose and oxygen than they photo/chemosynthesize
## consumers and decomposers
- both are heterotrophs
	- consumers, detritivores, and decomposers
- **heterotrophic process: cellular respiration**
- food web; primary, secondary, tertiary consumers, etc.
## energy transfer efficiency
- only 10% energy is net transferred across each trophic level; all of the energy is consumed, but the 90% excluded is burned in order to consume prey and maintain processes to stay alive
- this net transfer/loss includes energy obtained by decomposers
