# Arthropoda
- Crustaceans, Insects
- Various Orders
	- Coleoptera — Beetles
	- Diptera — Flies
	- Orthoptera — Crickets, Grasshoppers
	- Lepidoptera — Moths
	- Blattodea — Cockroaches
	- Odonata — Dragonflies
	- Hymenoptera — Ants, Bees, Wasps
- Insects make up 75% extant species; other arthropods make up 11%
	- 900,000 species; 400,000 are beetles
## Shared Characteristics
- Jointed segmentation: Head, thorax, abdomen
- Paired, jointed appendages
- Armor-like exoskeleton
- Open circulatory system with a dorsal tubular heart and aorta with ostia
### Ecdysis and Exuviae
#### Ecydsis
- Molting
- The exoskeleton cuticle is molted and shed
- Soft-bodied, increased fluids increase size before hardening
#### Exuviae
- The remnants of the exoskeleton that were shed in ecydsis

### Hexapoda
- Six legs in adulthood
- Beetles, bugs, flies, wasps, ants, grasshoppers
- **Three major body segments**
- One pair of antennae
#### Insecta
- Over 90% of known terrestrial arthropods are insects
- More than half of known species are insects
- Hyperdiverse
- **Three body regions, one pair of antennae, three pairs of legs in adulthood, and two, one, or no pairs of wings**
- Undergoes metamorphosis
	- Incomplete metamorphosis: Juveniles resemble adulthoods but do not have wings
	- Complete metamorphosis: Juveniles do not resemble adulthoods
		- Four distinct life stages: Egg, larvae, pupa, adult
		- Worm-like larvae with different stages of development
		- Resource partitioning
