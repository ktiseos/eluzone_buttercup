# Protists
- **Paraphyletic grouping** of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes
- Algae, Protozoa, Slime Molds
- Photosynthetic, Heterotrophic, Mixotrophic
- Various sexual life cycles
- Studied via samples, DNA fragments and overlapping sequence analysis; **environmental sequencing/metagenomics**
- Studied for…
	- Human Health Concerns (*Giardia lamblia*, Trypanosome, Malaria)
	- Ecological Issues
		- Primary producers/consumers
		- CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown to benthic reservoirs, outside of atmosphere
		- Algal blooms (red tides, toxins)
## Origin of Protists
- **Mitochondria: Endosymbiosis Theory**
	1. archaeal cell engulfed aerobic bacterium
	2. bacterium survived and formed an endosymbiotic relationship
	3. formation of mitochondria
- **Nuclear Envelope: Infolding Hypothesis**
	- infolding of plasma membrane surrounded chromosomes
	- created a double membrane with organelles (endoplasmic reticulum)
- **Chloroplast: Primary and Secondary Endosymbiosis**
	- **Primary Endosymbiosis:**
		- engulfed cyanobacteria; endosymbiosis theory
		- consider Gram bacteria
			- Gram-positive: thick cell wall of peptidoglycan on the outside
			- Gram-negative: thin cell wall of peptidoglycan with an outer phospholipid bilayer membrane (double membrane wall)
		- food vacuole contained one membrane, then cyanobacterium contained 2 membranes
		- one membrane was lost, resulting in a chloroplast with two bounding membranes
	- **Secondary Endosymbiosis:**
		- algal cell engulfed by a non-photosynthetic, heterotrophic eukaryote
			- either red or green algae
		- outer membrane of food vacuole, algal cell membrane, and two membranes of cyanobacterium
		- results in up to four membranes around chloroplast
		- also sometimes contains a remnant nucleus from the algal cell: **nucleomorph**
			- reduced set of genes and often a membrane
		- may have occurred multiple times depending on algaee
	- occurred in Archaeplastida (Plantae)
## Eukaryotic supergroups/clade
### Excavata
- excavated feeding groove
- Diplomonads, Parabasalids, Eugleenozoans
### Archaeplastida
- AKA Plantae supergroup
	- “Ancient plastids” — first evolution of plastids
- **Underwent two endosymbiotic events:**
	- **primary endosymbiosis** in all cases
	- **secondary endosymbiosis** in many cases
#### Red Algae
#### Chlorophytes
#### Charophytes
### Stramenophiles
- SAR Supergroup
#### Diatoms
#### Water Molds
#### Brown Algae
#### Golden Algae
### Alveolates
- SAR Supergroup
- **Synapomorphic** alveoli: membrane sacs inside the cell membrane
#### Dinoflagellates
- 3um
- modal unicellular organisms
- mostly marine and planktonic
- **feeding…**
	- ~50% are photosynthetic
	- ~50% lost chloroplast over time
	- some mixotrophic dinoflagellates
- **transport…**
	- two flagella:
		- one lines the **equatorial groove**, ribbon flagellum
		- one lines **sulcus**
		- 90 degrees/perpendicular to each other in most dinoflagellates
	- twirling in water
- **armored dinoflagellates…** possess hard parts known as **thecae**
	- thecae are made of cellulose
	- inside alveoli (inside cell membrane)
- **pigments:**
	- chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c
	- carotenoid
		- distinct reddish-brown coloring
- **complex life cycle…**
	- **resting cysts:** protected
	- multiple lifestages
- **ecological importance…**
	- primary producers as plankton and endosymbionts
	- **zooxanthellae** are endosymbiotic to corals, sponges, sea anemones, octopus
		- no armor; exchanges materials
		- 30,000 dinoflagellates per cubic millimeter of a coral polyp
		- **produces glycerol instead of starch for use in cell respiration**
	- red tides are dinoflagellate blooms
		- population explosion
		- 20% dinoflagellate species have toxins
			- assumed to deter predators (copepod zooplankton)
			- aerosolized can kill fish, make people ill/rashed
			- can accumulate in shellfish; bioaccumulation; **neurotoxins**
	- **bioluminescence**
		- glows/emits light when disturbed via wave action
			- assumed to protect against predators (cause to be consumed by another consumer)
- *Pfiesteria piscicida*
	- fish killer in southeast river deltas
	- peduncle: feeding tube
	- amoeboid stage and amoeboid cysts
	- undetected by fish
#### Apicomplexans
#### Ciliates
### Rhizarians
- SAR Supergroup
#### Radiolarians
#### Foraminifera
#### Cercozoans
### Amoebozoa
- Unikonta Supergroup
#### Slime molds
#### Tubulinids
#### Entamoebas
### Ophistokonts
- Unikonta Supergroup
#### Nucleariids
#### Choanoflagellates
## Aquatic Producers/Consumers
- **Phytoplankton:** photosynthetic, free-floating/swimming surface protists in salt and freshwater; includes some cyanobacteria
- **Zooplankton:** non-photosynthetic
- **Benthic** producers are multicellular protists anchored to a substrate in the subtidal or intertidal zones
- **Dinoflagellates:** endosymbiont protists
