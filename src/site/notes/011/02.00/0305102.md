# Aves
- *Archaeopteryx lithographica*
	- Transitional fossil from the late Jurassic period (~150 mya)
	- 1’8” long; size of a raven
	- *Archaeopteryx* sp. possessed:
		- Jaws with sharp teeth;
		- Fingers with claws;
		- Toes, with the 2nd toe possessing an extensible killing claw;
		- Long, bony tails;
		- & feathers on the body and flight feathers on their arms;
- Evolution from **Theropods:** Bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs
	- Evidence that many kinds of dinosaurs had feathers regardless of the ability of flight; all other extant animal groups lack feathers
	- Ancestral fossils were also bipedal
- Aves is a taxonomic class of animals that:
	- **Develop feathers and a beak;**
	- **Do not develop teeth** (gnitooth)
	- **Have high metabolism levels;**
	- **Develop a four-chambered heart;**
	- **Develop in hard-shelled amniotic eggs;**
	- **& develop a lightweight, strong skeleton.**
- Many of Aves’s characteristics are convergent but are consistent across groups, such as:
	- A homogenous body plan;
	- **Small body size:** The mass limit for flying birds is ~16kg, and most birds average at less than 1kg heavy and 50cm long;
	- Light weight;
	- And a streamlined, aerodynamic body.
- ~10,000+ defined as birds
	- Largely successful due to mobility via flight/swimming
- Several adaptations for flight:
	1. **Lightweight, rigid, strong skeleton:** loss of the teeth and tail, unnecessary, among other notable modifications:
		- **Enlarged, keeled sternum**
		- Beak lacks teeth;
		- Parts of the spine, especially the pelvis, fused;
		- Fused skull;
		- A fused and reduced tail known as a **pygostyle;**
	2. **Streamlined, fused bodies:**
		- Large, powerful flight muscles;
		- Reduced body weight: **Pneumatic bones** with struts and air spaces that connect to the respiratory system;
		- Asymmetrical reproductive organs, etc.;
	3. Highly modified forelimbs/pectoral limbs:
		- A highly modified **manus** (hand)
		- Fused carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges
	4. **Wings with *specialized flight feathers*;**
		- Asymmetrical flight feathers can utilize lift.
## General Characteristics
### Bird Feathers
#### Feather Anatomy
##### Shaft/Rachis
- **Shaft:** A hollow, tubical attachment for the feather to the follicle of the body
	- **Calamus:** The base of the shaft, without vanes attacheed
	- **Rachis:** The attachment for the barbules and barbs of the vane
##### Vanes
- A **vane** is a surface made from the interlocking of barbs and barbules
	- The **major vane** is the greater side, the **minor vane** is the lesser side
- **Barbs** are the larger branches attached to the shaft and rachis that subdivide into barbules
- **Barbule** branches have **hooklets** that lock within one another
#### Wing Anatomy
![Pasted image 20241010202927.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020241010202927.png)
#### Motion of Flight
- **Upwards motion/stroke:** The feather rotates in its follicle
	- Rotation/twist is possible due to asymmetry; reduces air resistance
- **Upwards movement:** the major vane points downwards, allowing air to slip through the wing; “broken” integrity of wing
- **Downwards movement/stroke:** the wing strokes downward; the integrity is reformed, adding lift and pulling the bird upwards
	- Air pressure pushes the major vane back upwards, repairing integrity
### Bird Feet
- Avian bipedalism is unique among vertebrates that can fly or glide
- Aves is digitigrade: birds walk on their toes with a unique tetrapodal leg anatomy formed from fused bones:
	- Lowest leg bone: the **tarsometatarsus**, and connected to a tibiotaurus by an intratarsal joint
	- Fused ankle and feet bones;
	- Three phalanges pointed forwards, and one pointed backwards
#### Anisodactyl
- **Three toes forward, one toe back**
	- **Hallux:** The backward toe, and the first digit
	- Digits are numbered clockwise from the hallux and possess respective number of phalanges
