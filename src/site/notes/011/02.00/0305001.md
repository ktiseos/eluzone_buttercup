- Study of ecology, ecosystems: natural history
- Environmental biology applied to a local (relative) scale (Northern California)
# “Structural Levels of Life”
- Compartmentalization of life with regard to the biosphere concept
- **Biology** — the study of life and living organisms, genetic adaptations and growth, taxonomy, evolution, identification
- Several unifying concepts to biological disciplines: **structural levels of life** and **emergent properties of life**
	- Structural levels reflect the complexity;
	- Emergent levels define what a living being is
- Some components of the structural levels do not consist of living things (molecules), but many do
1. **Molecule** — Non-living
2. **Cell** — Cumulation of molecules with a living, functioning concept
3. **Tissue**
4. **Organ** — Functional structure
5. **Organism** — Living entity
6. **Population** — A collective of the same kind of organism, dependent on where it is also specified
7. **Community** — Groups of populations within a specific area
8. **Ecosystem** — The community of organisms and the environment and resources which they use; both living and non-living components included
9. **Biosphere** — Every place on the planet which living things exist; non-living only, and specific to places and areas (environments)
# Emergent Properties of Life
- Combined characteristics which define life
- All living things have all of the below components:
	1. Order, **organization**, and hierarchy;
	2. The ability of **reproduction** for both cells and offspring;
	3. The ability to grow and **develop**;
	4. The need to use **energy**;
	5. The ability to maintain your body/**metabolize**;
	6. The ability to respond to the environment/**environmental stimuli**;
	7. The ability to **adapt** to the environment and genetics;
	8. and the ability to **evolve**.
# Scientific Method
1. Ask a **question**/make an observation
2. Propose a testable **hypothesis**
3. Develop a **deduction** (written as an if… clause)
4. **Testing**/experimentation/exposure
5. **Conclude** if the hypothesis has been supported or invalidated based on the tests
- Scientific **theories** are accepted explanations for a phenomenon that are based on large amounts of evidence obtained from testing vs. conjecture
- **Scientific method** is practiced through an individual group; **scientific process** is practiced via the larger scientific community
	- Publishing, peer review, scientific journals; passes through rapid, larger-scale acceptance/rejection
# Natural Selection and Speciation
- Living things use energy for metabolism, growth/development, and reproduction (in that order)
	- By using less energy on metabolism, more energy can go into development and reproduction
- **Evolution:** The change in a population’s genetic makeup (gene pool) through successive generations.  Populations evolve.
	- **Microevolution:** The small genetic changes that occur in a population.
	- **Macroevolution:** Long-term, large-scale evolutionary changes that occur in groups of species where new species are formed from ancestral species.
- **Selective Pressures**
	- Environmental resistance factors
	- Environmental pressures
	- **Natural selection pressures:** primary force is competition for resources within populations
	- **Environmental resistance:** physical and biological factors’ effect in preventing species from reproducing at maximum rate
- Natural selection affects the **gene pool** of the population
	- **Adaptation occurs at an individual level**
	- Shifting gene pools → biological evolution
	- **Differential reproduction:** a change in characteristic frequency in the population
		- Biological evolution occurs when the gene pool shifts
- **Different forms:**
	- Differential reproduction
	- Stabilizing selection
	- Intersexual selection
	- Adaptive radiation
	- Selective breeding
		- Phenotypic plasticity
- **Alfred Russell Wallace:** distinct differences found on the Malay archipelago: animals on the Western line had Asian ancestry, eastern had Australian ancestry
	- “Wallace Line”
- **Major tenets/assumptions of natural selection:**
	1. All species have immense reproductive potential unless checked/limited
	2. **Natural resources are limited which checks/limits species reproduction**
	3. Genetic variation exists in the population
	4. **Overpopulation/above capacity limits the number of surviving offspring in each generation**
	5. Some individuals with a specific phenotype have a greater fitness in the population than others
	6. **Favorable characteristics/phenotypes are more likely to prevail in the population in each generation**
- Stephen Jay Gould
- **Three outcomes result in intraspecific and interspecific competition:**
	- Avoidance via **resource partitioning**
	- **Extinction/death**
	- **Physical distance/separation of species
- **Niche**: a particular role or purpose that a specific population has in its environment at a given, specific period in history
	- **Fundamental niche:** All possible niches provided no competition from other species exist
	- **Realized niche:** Conditions under which species actually exist alongside competition
		- **Niche compression** occurs when competition is introduced (invasive species)
		- **Niche expansion** occurs during extinction/extirpation
		- **Niche shift**: A shift in behavior to avoid/reduce competition
	- Both niche types can:
		- Change in different periods of the lifecycle
		- Change between sexes
	- Wide/narrow niches
		- **Narrow width niche:** Only specialized to do a few things; narrow width of fundamental niches → threatened species
		- **Wide width niche:** Many possible specializations
- Speciation frequently occurs via various **isolating mechanisms:**
	- Geological isolation;
	- Ecological isolation;
	- Behavioral isolation;
	- Mechanical isolation;
	- Post-zygotic hybrid inviability, sterility, and breakdowns
## Geographic Variation
- Variation that occurs as a result of specific environmental pressures that create variation
	- **Clines**, where a gradual change occurs in one or more characteristics (Sierra Nevada elevation and blooming rates/times)
	- **Ecotypes**, where genotype and genetic strains in a population affect survival even in different geography (plants blooming at a specific time always regardless of geography)
	- **Geographical reproductive isolation**
- **Parapatric isolation** occurs adjacent to one another without geographic isolation, but without being overlapped; contaminated vs non-contaminated sections of soil
- **Polymorphism:** the  presence/occurrence of different forms in a habitat at the same time
