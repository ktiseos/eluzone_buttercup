- study of ecology, ecosystems: natural history
- environmental biology applied to a local (relative) scale (Northern California)
# “structural levels of life”
- compartmentalization of life with regard to the biosphere concept
- **biology** — the study of life and living organisms, genetic adaptations and growth, taxonomy, evolution, identification
- several unifying concepts to biological disciplines: structural levels and emergent properties of life
	- structural reflects the complexity
	- emergent defines what a living being is
- some components do not consist of living things (molecules), but many do
1. **molecule** — non-living
2. **cell** — cumulation of molecules with a living, functioning concept
3. **tissue**
4. **organ** — functional structure
5. **organism** — living entity
6. **population** — a collective of the same kind of organism, dependent on where it is also specified
7. **community** — groups of populations within a specific area
8. **ecosystem** — the community of organisms and the environment and resources which they use; both living and non-living components included
9. **biosphere** — every place on the planet which living things exist; non-living only, and specific to places and areas (environments)
# emergent properties of life
- combined characteristics which define life
- all living things have all of the below components
1. order, **organization**, and hierarchy
2. the ability of **reproduction** for both cells and offspring
3. the ability to grow and **develop**
4. the need to use **energy**
5. the ability to maintain your body/**metabolize**
6. the ability to respond to the environment/**environmental stimuli**
7. the ability to **adapt** to the environment and genetics
8. the ability to **evolve**
# scientific method
1. ask a **question**/make an observation
2. propose a testable **hypothesis**
3. develop a **deduction** (written as an if… clause)
4. **testing**/experimentation/exposure
5. **conclude** if the hypothesis has been supported or invalidated based on the tests
- scientific **theories** are accepted explanations for a phenomenon that are based on large amounts of evidence obtained from testing vs. conjecture
- **scientific method** is practiced through an individual group; **scientific process** is practiced via the larger scientific community
	- publishing, peer review, scientific journals; passes through rapid, larger-scale acceptance/rejection
# natural selection and speciation
- living things use energy for metabolism, growth/development, and reproduction in that order
- by using less energy on metabolism, more energy can go into development and reproduction
- **Evolution:** the change in a population’s genetic makeup (gene pool) through successive generations.  Populations evolve.
- **Microevolution:** the small genetic changes that occur in a population.
- **Macroevolution:** long-term, large-scale evolutionary changes that occur in groups of species where new species are formed from ancestral species.
- **selective pressures**
	- environmental resistance factors
	- environmental pressures
	- natural selection pressures: primary force is competition for resources within populations
	- **environmental resistance:** physical and biological factors’ effect in preventing species from reproducing at maximum rate
- natural selection affects the gene pool
	- adaptation occurs at an individual level
- shifting gene pools → biological evolution
- different forms
	- differential reproduction
	- stabilizing selection
	- intersexual selection
	- adaptive radiation
	- selective breeding
		- phenotypic plasticity
- alfred russell wallace: distinct differences found on the malay archipelago: animals on the western line had asian ancestry, eastern had australian ancestry
	- “wallace line”
- **major tenets/assumptions of natural selection:**
	- all species have immense reproductive potential unless checked/limited
	- **natural resources are limited which checks/limits species reproduction**
	- genetic variation exists in the population
	- **overpopulation/above capacity limits the number of surviving offspring in each generation**
	- some individuals with a specific phenotype have a greater fitness in the population than others
	- **favorable characteristics/phenotypes are more likely to prevail in the population in each generation**
- Stephen Jay Gould
- **differential reproduction:** a change in characteristic frequency in the population
	- biological evolution occurs when the gene pool shifts
- three outcomes result in intraspecific and interspecific competition:
	- avoid via **resource partitioning**
	- **extinction/death**
	- **physical distance/separation of species
- **niches**: a particular role or purpose that a specific population has in its environment at a given, specific period in history
	- **fundamental niche**: all possible niches provided no competition from other species exist
	- **realized niche**: conditions under which species actually exist alongside competition
		- **niche compression** when competition is introduced (invasive species)
		- **niche expansion** during extinction/extirpation
		- **niche shift**: a shift in behavior to avoid/reduce competition
	- both niche types can:
		- change in different periods of the lifecycle
		- change between sexes
	- wide/narrow niche
		- **narrow width niche:** only specialized to do a few things; narrow width of fundamental niches → threatened species
		- **wide niche:** many possible specializations
- speciation frequently occurs via various **isolating mechanisms**
	- geological isolation
	- ecological isolation
	- behavioral isolation
	- mechanical isolation
	- post-zygotic hybrid inviability, sterility, and breakdowns
## geographic variation
- variation that occurs as a result of specific environmental pressures that create variation
	- **clines**, where a gradual change occurs in one or more characteristics (Sierra Nevada elevation and blooming rates/times)
	- **ecotypes**, where genotype and genetic strains in a population affect survival even in different geography (plants blooming at a specific time always regardless of geography)
	- **geographical reproductive isolation**
- **parapatric isolation** occurs adjacent to one another without geographic isolation, but without being overlapped; contaminated vs non-contaminated sections of soil
- **polymorphism**: the  presence/occurrence of different forms in a habitat at the same time
