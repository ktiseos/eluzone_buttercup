5 sdc
- all present through development stages
- hollow (tubular) **dorsal** nerve chord; prominent, easy to spot; structurally complex in vertebrates and has more developed brain vs. anterior sectioning of inverts; brain and spinal chord on vertebrates, straight cord on invert
	- landmark
- notochord; directly underneath nerve chord; flexible rod-like structure direct ventral to nerve chord, likely touching it; used for motility/muscle attachment
	- vertebrate modification → vertebral column; not bones, but the intervertebral disks
- pharyngeal gill slits/clefts
	- pharyngeal basket: large pharyngeal region with openings; *high surface area*, gas exchange and filter feeding
	- gill bars where slits slot between
	- embryonic development in many vertebrates who do not have them now
	- region multidevelops: ears, jawbones, tonsils, thymus gland
- post-anal tail: extension beyond the anus
- endostyle \*
	- ventralmost side of pharyngeal basket
	- gland that secretes mucus
	- mucus coats gill bars and gels, making food particles stick to gills during filter feeding
	- u-shaped gland, slightly larger than gill bars
	- vertebrate modification: thyroid gland in neck
3 subphyla
- cephalochordata:
	- lancelets
	- notably different regions; comparable to planaria platyhelminth dissections
	- caecum modification: hepatic caecum: homologous to liver: runs across pharyngeal basket; darker region
		- atrium chamber, atriocore
- urochordata
	- tunicates
	- large middle focal pharyngeal basket; literal basket
	- excurrent incurrent siphons
	- sessile in adulthood, motile larvae
	- 5 minute metamorphosis, torsion, retraction
	- solitary or colonial
- vertebrata
	- ammocoetes (lamprey)
		- larva
