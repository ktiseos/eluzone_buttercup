# signal transduction
### examples include:
- **etiolation** vs. de-etiolation (greening) of a potato: changes in response to exposure of light/natural daylight
	- etiolated plants respond to stimulus which they interpret as part of underground, lightless, no photosynthesis, no waterbehavior: they have no chlorophyll present, narrow and non-expanded leaves, tall stems, and few or short/stubby roots
		- eudicot seeds retain the hook under etiolation
	- de-etiolation is known as “greening” because the plant produces organ advancements that utilize photosynthesis
- **phototropism**; stimulus and receptors when light is sensed
## process
- **reception:** a sensory cell receives an external stimulus/extracellular signal (ex. light, touch, electronegativity)
	- requires the presence of a **receptor**: a protein that undergoes a shape change in response to a specific stimulus (ex. potato phytochromes)
	- the receptor is typically but not always in the cell membrane
- **transduction:** a hormone is released through the body
	- changes the form of the information and amplifies it: cause a large response to small signals
	- **relay proteins (kinases)**
		- kinases: enzymes that phosphorylate other enzymes and activate them, causing a positive cascade
		- called relay proteins and are generally kinases
	- **second messengers**
		- usually either ions (Calcium ions) or small molecules (cyclic GMP, cGMP) that have been stored somewhere and are released during transduction
		- cause something else to occur
	- usually both processes occur, but the occurrence of either causes a response
- **response:** effector/response cells receive the hormone and process an internal change
	- three notable forms of cell responses
	- **altering gene expression** / altering transcription
	- **post-translational modifications**
	- **alteration of membrane transport** / transport  across the membrane
## hormones
- **plant hormones affect target cells**: the target cells may be the same or different cells in plants
- plant hormones may be recognized as plant growth regulators; pgr tends to reference hormones that are produced in unusually large amounts
- **five main hormones in plants**: Auxin, cytokine, Gibberellins,
### auxin
- auxin class causes cell elongation or growth in a direction in response to light
	- promotes the elongation of the coleoptile molecules
	- derived from words to increase
	- shoot architecture/phyllotaxy
	- activates vascular cambium from dormancy
- auxin has various practical uses:
	- **root-gel/rooting hormone** uses IAA/IBA from adventitious roots in stem cutting; propagation
	- **eudicot weed killer** uses synthetic 2,4-D
- multiple kinds within the class
	- **IAA: indoleacetic acid**
		- most common auxin
		- naturally occurring
	- **IBA: indolebutyric acid**
	- **synthetic auxins**
- all auxins are produced in the shoot tips in the apical meristems and adjacent tissues
	- can also be produced in young leaves and seeds
- auxins are transported from the shoot tips to the root tips
	- **polar transport**
	- 1 cm/hr: too fast to be effusion and too slow to be in xylem water-conducting cells
		- actually moves through parenchyma cells within the xylem
		- assistive diffusion
		- transporter are only based in the **basal cell membrane** (lower cell membrane); maintained in the lower area and goes much faster than standard diffusion
#### Acid Growth Hypothesis
- environment conditions for AGH to occur:
	- **increased turgor pressure**
	- **loosened cell wall**
- conditional steps:
	- auxin binds to the receptors in the membrane and activates the proton pumps
	- hydrogen ions are pumped into the cell wall, increasing the acidity
	- electrochemical gradient generated; anions are influxed/permeate; more solutes in cell
		- increases turgor pressure
	- acid conditions activate expansins that move down on the wall and disrupt/remove the Hydrogen bonds and enzymes that cleave hemicellulose
#### Apical Dominance

- controls branching via the dominance of the terminal bud
- **several hormones at play:**
	- **sucrose** used in the shoot tip and controls growth of axillary buds
	- **auxin** in shoot tip indirectly inhibits bud growth; auxin highest concentrations are near the shoot tip
	- **auxin causes strigolactone** production in the axillary buds that directly inhibit bud growth
	- **cytokinin** stimulates bud growth; reverse concentrations of auxin
### cytokinins
- modified adenine
- natural cytokinin: **zeatin**
- produced in roots and moves up towards xylem sap to the tip of the plant
- **used in cell division/control of division**
	- tissue culture in parenchymal explants
	- anti-aging/preservative of leaf
- callus from equal amounts of auxin and cytokinin: a mass of undifferentiated cells
	- auxin increase → root stimulus
	- cytokinin increase → shoot stimulus
	- must have both present to form callus and differentiate
### Gibberellins
- gibberellic acid/GA
- 1900s : rice plants with foolish seedling disease
	- Gibberella fungal chemical secreted
- 100s of naturally occurring GAs; GAx
	- GA1 is most prevalent and most effective
- mainly produced in young roots and leaves, as well as seeds
- causes
	- stem elongation via cell elongation and cell division
	- stem bolting
		- rosette form of leaves; shortened internodes creating a spiral, flowered effect
			- lettuce
		- bolting causes internodes to lengthen when necessary to flower
		- rapid internode expansion
	- fruit growth and internode growth
		- preventing disease
	- germination
		- cereal (grass) seeds
		- aleurome inside the seed absorbs water
		- GA is excreted and diffused acrross endosperm into aleurome
		- aleurome response produces alpha amylase
		- alpha amylase digests starch into sugars; sugar is used to fuel growth
