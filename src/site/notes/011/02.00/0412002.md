# Signal Transduction
### … is involved in:
#### Tropisms
##### Mechanical Pressure
###### Thigmomorphogenesis
- responses to touch or wind; more often wind
- differences in form
- wind: thicker cell walls, more lignin
###### Thigmotropism
- only responses to touch
- tendrils twine around something else for support
- bean plants
- days or hours
##### Phototropism
- receptors process a stimuli from light waves
###### Etiolation
- **ETIOLATION** vs. de-etiolation (greening) of a vegetable: the occurrence of changes in response to exposure of light/natural daylight
	- Etiolated plants respond to stimuli that they interpret as associated with behavior underground, without light, photosynthesis, and water. They have:
		- no production of chlorophyll;
		- narrow, non-expanded leaves;
		- tall stems;
		- few roots that are short/stubby;
		- (specific to eudicot seeds) a retained hook
	- De-etiolation is known as “greening” because the plant produces organ advancements that utilize photosynthesis
###### Circadian Rhythms
- circadian rhythms of movement; daily and seasonal movements/responses
	- blue light is also involved, but more information on phytochrome
	- near-day responses
	- occurs even under sensory deprivation
	- free-running: no environmental cues
		- every 21 up to 27 hours
	- synchronized via entrainment with the environment
- biological clocks: internal, endogenous
	- maintained by clock genes that produce transcription factors (TF<sub>1</sub>)
		- various factors used for different, non-repressive factors
		- one transcription factor produced will, after a time lag, repress clock genes
	- “molecular clock”
- 3 kinds of flowering responses
	1. **short day plant**
		- flowers if the night is longer than a critical value
		- P<sub>FR</sub> inhibits flowering in plants until it is degraded
		- chrysanthemums
	2. **long day plants**
		- flowers if the night is shorter than a critical value
		- PFR stimulates flowering in plants if remaining
		- iris
	3. **day neutral plants**
		- flowers when physiologically ready, regardless of time of day
	- photo-reversible process
	- caused by florigen hormone
	- symplastic protein: plasmodesma, leaves (phytochrome), apical meristem
##### Gravitropism
- response to the pull of gravity
- shoots grow away from gravity (negative)
- roots grow towards (positive)
	- central column root cap (near vascular bundles) senses gravity
		- Statolith hypothesis: amyloplast stones sense gravity (heavy with starch); lower portion of root cell; amyloplast pressure on cell membrane; proteins sense pressure and signal determining where weight is
		- fountain effect: auxin redistributes in polar transport and more of it remains on the lower side
			- calcium also redistributed
#### Environmental Stresses
##### Drought Tolerance
- controls stomata during droughts; maintains drought tolerance
	- drying/dessication response
- stoma structure:
	- guard cells have microfibril cellulose cords wrapped radially around
	- inner walls are thicker than outer walls
	- guard cells are attached at top and bottom
- stomas open as a result of increased turgor pressure: attachment causes the guard cells to pull apart
	- also see increased solute concentration
	- environmental cues: blue-light receptors, decrease in internal concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the leaf, etc.
	- environmental cue transduced → outwards H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proton pump
		- creates an electrochemical gradient
	- potassium channels open; potassium enters the cell passively
	- cotransport uses the electrochemical gradient: H<sup>+</sup> enters passively, chlorine ions enter through energy
	- chloroplasts that create starch in the guard cell increase solute concentration; water moves in passively
- stomas close due to drought stress
	- ABA docks to receptors of guard cells
	- signal transduction → proton pump stops immediately
		- H<sup>+</sup> stops moving; electrochemical gradient ends
	- proton and chloride channels
		- hydrogen and chlorine ions exit; decrease solute concentration
##### Flooding
- roots are unable to get oxygen for aerobic respiration
- ethylene produced → cell death in roots
	- forms canals for oxygen to travel from above flood to roots
##### Salt
- drying/dessication; evaporation; minerals left behind from evaporation → soils are left with toxic materials
- salt stress
- sodium toxicity
- ions disrupt water potential gradient
- more solutees in central vacuoles
- salts are taken in and excreted on leaves
#### Nastic Responses
- quick responses
- not growth responses
- movement of water, changes in turgor pressure across entire leaves
- slower action potentials that involve ions on the cell membrane; connected by plasmodesmata
	- membrane depolarization; negativee internal positively charges or zeroes; certain ions cross membrane
	- depolarization propagates across the membranes/cells
	- swollen pulvinus on the base of a leaf; changes in turgor prressure end propagation
#### Growth Hormone Responses
##### Apical Dominance
- Control of branching of stems via the dominance of the terminal bud
- **Several hormones at play:**
	- **Sucrose**
		- **found in:** shoot tip
		- **purpose:** controls growth of axillary buds
	- **Auxin**
		- **found in:** shoot tip
			- highest concentrations are near the shoot tip
		- **purpose:** indirectly inhibits bud growth via strigolactone production in the axillary buds
	- **Strigolactone**
		- **found in:** axillary buds
		- **purpose:** directly inhibits bud growth
	- **Cytokinin:**
		- **purpose:** stimulates bud growth
			- reverse concentrations of auxin
##### Acid-Growth Hypothesis
- environment conditions for AGH to occur:
	- **increased turgor pressure**
	- **loosened cell wall**
- conditional steps:
	- auxin binds to the receptors in the membrane and activates the proton pumps
	- hydrogen ions are pumped into the cell wall, increasing the acidity
	- electrochemical gradient generated; anions are influxed/permeate; more solutes in cell
		- increases turgor pressure
	- acid conditions activate expansins that move down on the wall and disrupt/remove the hydrogen bonds and enzymes that cleave hemicellulose
##### Seed Dormancy
- promotes **seed dormancy** — slowing or stopping growth
	- compare ratio of ABA to other growth promoting hormones
	- dormancy in hibernation, drought/extreme conditions
	- as a seed matures, it dehydrates/dessicates;
		- sensitive to dessication; aba increases to slow maturation
		- aba increases 100x compared to beginning of maturation
	- ABA promotes production of proteins that prevent dessication
- dormancy is stopped by inactivating or removing ABA and producing more GA; many methods
	- light cue inactivates ABA
	- cold cue inactivates ABA
	- directly washing away/removing ABA (seen in desert plants; flash floods interacting with seed coats)
##### Senescence
- age-induced decline
	- programmed senescing (removal)
	- everything is removed before abscission occurs
	- programmed cell death
- occurs after a burst of ethylene
##### Abscission
- Over time, **auxin concentration decreases**
- Petiole has reduced auxin, which makes it more sensitive to ethylene
	- **2 zones on the petiole:**
		1. **protection zone** preventing infection
		2. **abscission zone** where cell walls weaken and leaf detaches
			- outside of the protection zone
##### Fruit Ripening
- **Positive feedback loop of ethylene production**
- Accompanied by various effects:
	- Enzymes digest cellulose
	- Chlorophyll is degraded and exported
	- Starch digests into sugar and sweetens
	- Colors and aroma change
- **“One bad apple spoils the barrel”**
	- A damaged apple produces ethylene and will ripen nearby apples quickly due to positive feedback loop
	- Ethylene-absorptive bags prevent cross-fruit ripening
##### Stem Growth
- Auxin class causes cell elongation or growth in a direction in response to light
	- promotes the elongation of the coleoptile molecules
	- derived from words to increase
	- shoot architecture/phyllotaxy
	- activates vascular cambium from dormancy
- GA causes:
	- stem elongation via cell elongation and cell division
	- stem bolting
		- rosette form of leaves; shortened internodes creating a spiral, flowered effect
			- lettuce
		- bolting causes internodes to lengthen when necessary to flower
		- rapid internode expansion
	- fruit growth and internode growth
		- preventing disease
	- germination
		- cereal (grass) seeds
		- aleurome inside the seed absorbs water
		- GA is excreted and diffused acrross endosperm into aleurome
		- aleurome response produces alpha amylase
		- alpha amylase digests starch into sugars; sugar is used to fuel growth
## Steps in Signal Transduction
1. **RECEPTION:** a sensory cell receives an external stimulus/extracellular signal (ex. light, touch, electronegativity)
	- requires the presence of a **receptor**: a protein that undergoes a shape change in response to a specific stimulus (ex. potato phytochromes)
	- the receptor is typically but not always in the cell membrane
2. **TRANSDUCTION:** a hormone is released through the body
	- changes the form of the information and amplifies it: cause a large response to small signals
	1. **release of relay proteins (kinases)**
		- kinases: enzymes that phosphorylate other enzymes and activate them, causing a positive cascade
		- called relay proteins and are generally kinases
	2. **release of second messengers**
		- usually either ions (Calcium ions) or small molecules (cyclic GMP, cGMP) that have been stored somewhere and are released during transduction
		- cause something else to occur
	- usually both processes occur, but the occurrence of either causes a response
3. **RESPONSE:** effector/response cells receive the hormone and process an internal change
	- THREE notable forms of cell responses
		1. **altering gene expression** / altering transcription
		2. **post-translational modifications**
		3. **alteration of membrane transport** / transport  across the membrane
# Important Signal Hormones
- **Plant hormones affect target cells**: the target cells may be the same or different cells in plants
- Plant hormones may be recognized as plant growth regulators; PGR tends to reference hormones that are produced in unusually large amounts
- **Five main hormones in plants**: Auxin class, Cytokine class, Gibberellins class, Abscicic Acid, Ethylene
## Abscicic Acid

	- tissue culture in parenchymal explants
	- anti-aging/preservative of leaf
- callus from equal amounts of auxin and cytokinin: a mass of undifferentiated cells
	- auxin increase → root stimulus
	- cytokinin increase → shoot stimulus
	- must have both present to form callus and differentiate
## Ethylene

				- Phytochrome Far-Red (P<sub>FR</sub>)
					- **Far-red light peak absorption: 730nm**
- **Phytochrome is produced by plants in response to…**
	- Etiolation
	- Seed germination
# Plant Defenses
- Plants need to **defend against:**
	- **Herbivores** (Plant Eaters): Rabbits, deer, insects
	- **Pathogens** (Disease-causing viruses and organisms) bacteria, fungi
	- Unable to move
- **Two kinds of defenses: constitutive and induced**
## Constitutive Defenses
- **Constitutive defenses…** which are always present, but expensive
1. **at the molecular level:** secondary chemicals
	- opium poppy sap — opium, morphine, codeine
	- chrysanthemum pyrethrins
		- aromatic phenolics
		- *Conium maculatum* (hemlock) coniine — alkaloid poisons
2. **at the cellular level:** sharp raphide crystals that affect biting
3. **at the tissue level:** dense lignin
4. **at the organ level:** modified pointy defenses made from tough tissue such as spines, thorns, deceptive butterfly eggs
## Pathogen-Induced Defenses
- **Pathogen-induced defenses…** induced by the presence/attack of pathogens; made as necessary
- tending to enter through stomata
### Hypersensitive Response
- **a local, quicker response,** taking a few hours
	- Stomatal closure;
	- Producing targeted pathogenic toxins;
	- Increasing the strength/size of neighboring cells; walling off;
	- Programmed cell death
### Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR)
- systemic response; **a plantwide response** that takes several days
	- Alarm hormone — Methyl salicylate (MeSA)
		- related to aspirin
		- **hormone is transported through phloem**
	- Up-regulates gene transcription for pathogen-related defense
## Herbivore-Induced Defense
- proteinase inhibitors bind to proteinase enzymes in herbivores’ mouths and digestive tracts and digest proteins
	- normally present to a lower degree in plants before induced
- causes herbivores to get sick
### Systemin
- in scenarios of mechanical wounding caused by herbivores that takes several days
- small polypeptide produced: 18 amino acids: systemin
- travels through phloem to target cells and causes production of jasmonic acid
	- Jasmonic Acid activates genes for herbivore-related defense including proteinase inhibitors
### Methyl Jasmonate
- volatile
- other plants can pick up this signal regardless of species and defend pre-emptively against herbivores
### Pheromones
- attracts non-herbivore insects; **parasitoids**
	- often wasps
	- parasitizing other insects and laying eggs; develop larvae that eat frrom inside out
