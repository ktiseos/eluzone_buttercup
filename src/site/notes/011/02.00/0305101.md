# Taxonomy and Keying
- 10–100mil species on earth today
- **classification of humans**
	- Domain – **Eukarya**
		- Organisms with a nucleus in each cell enclosing the genetic material, as well as additional membrane-bound organelles, including mitochondria; cells averaging about 100 micrometers in diameter. May be unicellular, filamentous, colonial, or multicellular.
	- Kingdom - **Animalia**
		- Multicellular organisms requiring complex organic substances for food; food usually ingested.
	- Phylum - **Chordata**
		- Animals with notochord, dorsal hollow nerve chord, pharyngeal “gill” pouches in pharynx (similar to the throat area in human embryos) at some stage of life cycle.
	- Class - **Mammalia**
		- Young nourished by milk glands, skin with hair, body cavity divided by a muscular diaphragm, red blood cells without nuclei, three ear bones, high body temperature.
	- Order - **Primates**
		- Tree dwellers or their descendants, usually with fingers and flat nails, sense of smell reduced.
	- Family - **Hominidae**
		- Flat face, eyes forward, color vision, upright, bipedal locomotion.
	- Genus - ***Homo***
		- Large brain, speech, long childhood
	- Species - ***Homo sapiens***
		- Prominent chin, high forehead, sparse body hair.
- **Dichotomous keys:**
	- **couplets:** series of choices for two alternatives
	- must be appropriately matched to area or taxon
	- making keys:
		- examine similarities/differences in characteristics
		- must be dichotomous, not trichotomous
		- don’t use vague statements; quantity and detail
		- make couplets refer to differences in the same characteristic
		- begin couplet choices with the same word
		- use obvious characteristics
		- use positive statements/include them
# Nomenclature and Domains
> [!NOTE] Introduction:
> It is important to understand that classification schemes reflect the views of those that constructed them, and that the answers about relationships continue to be uncovered. \[…] The point is that our system is not perfect, but becomes continually refined as we learn more about the living things and how they are related. A classification scheme allows us to find and frame the questions that we need to answer.
- first attempt at nomenclature: 1700, **Carl von Linne/Carolus Linnaeus**
	- hierarchal classification
	- kingdom, family, species
- systematics
- phylogenetic relationships and dna sequencing
- 1950s: **Robert Whittaker**
	- broad classification for all forms until 21st century
	- *Monera* kingdom for prokaryotes
	- *Protista*
- late 20th: **Carl Woese**
	- microbiological discovery of bacteria and archaea
	- rRNA sequencing
	- three domain system: *Archaea*, *Bacteria*, *Eukarya*
	- phased out kingdom level
- protists are a “group”
# Three Domains
