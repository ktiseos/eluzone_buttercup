# Taxonomy and Keying
- 10–100mil species on earth today
- **classification of humans**
	- Domain – **Eukarya**
		- Organisms with a nucleus in each cell enclosing the genetic material, as well as additional membrane-bound organelles, including mitochondria; cells averaging about 100 micrometers in diameter. May be unicellular, filamentous, colonial, or multicellular.
	- Kingdom - **Animalia**
		- Multicellular organisms requiring complex organic substances for food; food usually ingested.
	- Phylum - **Chordata**
		- Animals with notochord, dorsal hollow nerve chord, pharyngeal “gill” pouches in pharynx (similar to the throat area in human embryos) at some stage of life cycle.
	- Class - **Mammalia**

	- must be appropriately matched to area or taxon
	- making keys:
		- examine similarities/differences in characteristics
		- must be dichotomous, not trichotomous
		- don’t use vague statements; quantity and detail
		- make couplets refer to differences in the same characteristic
		- begin couplet choices with the same word

# Nomenclature and Domains
> [!NOTE] Introduction:
> It is important to understand that classification schemes reflect the views of those that constructed them, and that the answers about relationships continue to be uncovered. \[…] The point is that our system is not perfect, but becomes continually refined as we learn more about the living things and how they are related. A classification scheme allows us to find and frame the questions that we need to answer.
- first attempt at nomenclature: 1700, **Carl von Linne/Carolus Linnaeus**
	- hierarchal classification

	- Light weight;
	- And a streamlined, aerodynamic body.

	1. **Lightweight, rigid, strong skeleton:** loss of the teeth and tail, unnecessary, among other notable modifications:
		- **Enlarged, keeled sternum**
		- Beak lacks teeth;
		- Parts of the spine, especially the pelvis, fused;

		- Asymmetrical reproductive organs, etc.;
	3. Highly modified forelimbs/pectoral limbs:

		- Fused carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges
	4. **Wings with *specialized flight feathers*;**
		- Asymmetrical flight feathers used for lift.
## General Characteristics
### Bird Feathers
#### Feather Anatomy
##### Shaft/Rachis
- **Shaft:** A hollow attachment for the feather to the follicle of the body
- **Rachis:** The attachment for the barbules and barbs of the vane
##### Vanes
- A **vane** is a surface made from the interlocking of barbs and barbules
	- The **major vane** is the greater side, the **minor vane** is the lesser side
- **Barbs** are the larger branches attached to the shaft and rachis that subdivide into barbules
- **Barbule** branches have **hooklets** that lock within one another
#### Wing Anatomy
#### Motion of Flight
- **Upwards motion/stroke:** The feather rotates in its follicle
	- Rotation/twist is possible due to asymmetry; reduces air resistance
- **Upwards movement:** the major vane points downwards, allowing air to slip through the wing; “broken” integrity of wing
- **Downwards movement/stroke:** the wing strokes downward; the integrity is reformed, adding lift and pulling the bird upwards
	- Air pressure pushes the major vane back upwards, repairing integrity
### Bird Feet
