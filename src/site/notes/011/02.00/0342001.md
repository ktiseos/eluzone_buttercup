# chapter 1
**disease:** abnormal, bodily, impairs functioning, has signs and symptoms (seen/feelings)
- **infectious disease:** disease caused by a host organism with pathogenetic microbes (make suffering; prions, viruses, bacteria, protozoa)
**EID:** emerging infectious disease → disease that "emerged" in the past 20-30 years; re-emerging infectious diseases decreased in prevalence at one time and have reappeared recently
- antibiotic-resistant pathogens can cause EIDs (_staphylococcus aureus_, tuberculosis)
**parasite:** organism that feeds on other life (host)
- **macroscopic parasite:** can be seen without magnification; **ectoparasites** feed outside, like blood feeders; **endoparasites** live within (worms)
    - **arthropod vector:** transfers microbial pathogens, often ectoparasite
**pathogen:** organism that harms another organism
- **opportunistic pathogen:** will not normally cause disease unless in special circumstances (e. coli, pneumocystis jirovecii)
- **microbial pathogen:** too small to be seen without magnification (see path. microbes)
**ecology:** the study of organisms and their interactions with the environment
- **infectious disease medical ecology** studies host pathogens and environment → infectious disease
- **symbiosis:** the living together of two or more different organisms. **mutualism** both partners benefit, **commensalism** one benefits and one is neutral, **parasitism** see parasite
- symbiotic relationships can change
**agents of infectious diseases: prions, viruses, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, fungi, macroparasites, ectoparasites**
- mad cow disease, creutzfeldt-jakobs
- hiv, ebola, polio, rabies
- bacteria, _e. coli_, salmonella, std
- protozoa, malaria, sleeping sickness
- yeast, _coccidioides_
- worms
- vectors
**agents must cause an infectious disease by**
1. transportation to host
2. colonization or invasion of host
3. grow/fulfill life cycle
4. evade host defense mechanisms
5. damage the host thru mech. chem or molec. means
6. leave and invade another host

- infectious diseases cause diseases within a host organism through pathogenetic microbes like viruses, prions, protozoa
- eids are infectious diseases which recently appeared/infected the given population, or diseases which receded in prevalence but reappeared within the community recently: ebola, covid-19
- symbiosis: the relationship between two or more different organisms which live with another. there are mutualistic, commensalistic, and parasitic relationships: a parasitic relationship is e. coli in your bladder, which benefits the pathogen but harms you
- parasitism: see above, a symbiotic relatonship where one organism benefits by harming another
- parasite: an organism that feeds on other life; blood-feeders like mosquitoes are ectoparasites, which feed outside of the organism
- host: an organism which another lives on or off of and develops a symbiotic relationship with. humans are host to a range of symbiotic relationships; in a parasitic relationship like pathogenetic e. coli, they are the host being harmed at the benefit of the organism
- pathogen: an organism that harms another organism in any way
- the political ecology of infectious disease: infectious diseases can be influenced by environmental changes, and political decisions and globalization can influence these changes in turn. our governments' political decisions and how they influence the environment causes changes which give rise to eids and other diseases found in nonhuman hosts, which may spread to humans through evolution. swine flu rose in prevalence due to factory use in the livestock industry: the unhealthy nature of these factories increases the virulence rate of swine flu, as does the mortality
# chapter 2
- **prokaryotes and eukaryotes, cells**
    - **cell theory:** all organisms are made of 1+ cells; cells are the smallest living things; cells arise through division of previously existing cells
    - **cells have** plasma membrane, cytosol, chromosomes, and ribosomes
	    - **prokaryotes** have no nucleus or membrane bound organelles, includes bacteria and archaea
	        - external, cell envelope, and internal sections
	        - **cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosome, chromosomes, cell wall**
	        - some bacteria have: flagella, pili, fimbriae, **capsules, slime layers,** inclusions, actin cytoskleton, endospores
	        - **glycocalyx** coating on cell wall: slime layer loosely org/attached, capsule heavily
	    - **eukaryotes** have membrane bound organelles, double membrane bound nucleus with chromosomes; includes algae, protozoa, fungi, orgs
	        - external structures, cell boundary, organelles inside cell membrane (includes cytoplasm, nucleus, organelles, locomotor organelles, ribosomes, and cytoskeleton)
- **bacteria:**
    - glycocalyx inhibits phagocytosis of wbc, which adds to pathogenicity; the capsule coating blocks phagocytes from finding bacteria, so bacteria can multiply and infect
    - glycocalyx also helps form biofilms and protects from dehydration
    - **biofilms**: layered groups of microorgs enclosed in a polymeric matrix; highly adherent. 99% of bacteria live in biofilms
    - biofilms accumulate on damaged tissues; they are very resistant to antiseptics and antibiotics and help increase sharing of genetic material. they are key in infections and diseases
    - fimbriae and pili are appendags; pili is longer, sex pilus is used to transfer dna
cell shapes: **monomorphic or pleomorphic**
    - mono is one shape: **coccus, bacillus, vibrio, spirillum or spirochete** (round, oblong, curved oblong, spiral)
    - pleo varies in shape and size, and numbers: diplo- or strepto (two or a chain)
    - coccus: tetrads, sarcinae, staphylo (sarc. eight cube, a bunch; also has diplo and strepto)
    - bacilli are v shaped or palisades; v shape or side by side wall
- **cell envelope** either gram positive or gram negative
	- thick cell wall made of peptidoglycan, cell membrane
    - negative: outer cell membrane, thin layer (cell wall), inner cell wall
    - animals do not have cell walls; bacteria and archaea cell walls diff
    - gram-positive walls: acid-fast bacteria chemicals, mycolic acid helps survive desiccation and staining, acid-fast stain
    - gram-negative walls have phospholipids, proteins, and **lipopolysaccharide**
        - lipid A can be toxic and impede disease treatment
- **gram stain:** a stain that distinguishes cell wall types
    - crystal violet dye
    - gram-positive keeps cv and is purple stain; negative loses and stains red
    - gram stain diagnoses and helps with treatment
- **archaea**
    - **archaea:** archaea domain; closer related to eukarya as they share ribosomal rna and similar synthesis / subunit structures; unique membrane lipids and cell walls (no peptidoglycan)

- **protists**
	- protista kingdom, eukarya domain
    - algae, protozoa
    - algae are photoautotrophic, unicellular, sometimes chemoheterotrophic; classified by differences in pigments, food preserve, structures and types

# chapter 3
- **history of infectious disease**
	- "food fight"; humans are fast food of pathogens
	- pathogens on top of food chain; predators
	- "ancient diseases" shared by close relatives, great apes
- hunter-gatherer lifestyles constantly moved, minimized transmission of pathogens; "sedentary" growth through agriculture led to livestock, leading to zoonoses → animal pathogens transferring to humans in close contact
- early cities: feces and fecal-oral transmission became problem, rodent vectors, close contact human transmission
- era of spectulation: unknown microbes, unknown epidemics, ie black death
    - believed to be miasma
    - microbial pathogens unseen
    - "wee animalcules": 1600s: anton van leeuwenhoek → bacteria and protozoa
    - 1700s: smallpox vaccine: edward jenner: triggered cross-reactive antibodies that helped boy survive smallpox → vaccinia virus, first disease successfully eradicatd
    - ignas semmelweiss: attempted handwashing to decrease spread of disease
        - nosocomial infection: infection acquired in healthcare
        - joseph lister: carbolic acid disinfectant/antiseptic, wash hands, patients dying from infections decreased
- pasteur and koch: **golden age of microbiology**
    - **louis pasteur:** proved microbes were everywhere, fermentation studies, foundation of germ theory of disease, rabies vaccine
    - **robert koch:** 4 steps to prove microbe caused disease: **koch's postulates** → proves germ theory of disease (**specific microbe can invade another organism and cause a specific disease**
        1. causative agent must be isolated and absent of healthy hosts
        2. microbe must be grown in pure culture
        3. if introduced into healthy host, the host must receive this disease
        4. the microbe must be reisolated from the host
