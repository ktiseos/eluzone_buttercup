# Interactions
- cooperation vs. competition for resources
- different trophic levels incorporated:
	- producers, decomposers, and nutrients
	- consumers
		- herbivores are primary consumers
		- predators are secondary and above
		- parasites and scavengers
- **predator-prey relationship:** one organism captures/ingests the other organism
	- food chains are strands of food webs which involve several predator-prey relationships
	- food webs are complexes of predator-prey relationships
## Predation
- **Protists:** Paramecium and amoeba, paramecium and yeast
	- sweeping food to engulf, phagocytosis
- **Fungi:** *Arthrobotrys* fungus and nematode worms; constricting, capturing, and digesting prey through infecting hyphae
- **Carnivorous plants:** Venus flytrap, Sundew, *Darlingtonia* pitcher plant
	- seeking nitrogen in nitrogen-poor environments
	- digestive enzymes to break down insects
	- triggers and sticky substances to capture insects
- **Animals:** Hydra and Daphnia
	- Cnidaria and Crustacea
	- Nematocysts, poison dart-like, neurotoxins and capture
### Avoiding Predation
#### Camouflage

- *Biston betularia* and bark; light/dark morphs
#### Warning Camouflage
- Warning/Aposomatic Coloration
- Poison dart frogs, tomato frogs; high toxicity/gummy toxicity
#### Mimicry
- Can be through appearance, behavior, sound, or scent
- **Batesian:** a palatable, harmless creature mimics a harmful/noxious species
	- Parasitic mimicry
	- Coral Snake (Venomous) vs. King Snake (Batesian); Monarch and Viceroy butterflies
- **Müllerian:** various animals which are noxious/harmful share characteristic appearances for protection and mutual benefits

### Parasitism
- One organism benefits, the other is harmed
	- Tapeworms and vertebrates: **Parasites** that don’t kill host
		- Parasitic cestoda
		- Underdone/raw pork
		- The oncosphere or hexacanth was not designed for frolic, his part may be described perhaps as coldly diabolic….
