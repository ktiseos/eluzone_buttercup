# 20240122 | animal tissues
- analysis of organisms on a multicellular level (specialized cells)
- **tissues**: groups of similar cells with similar embryonic development and function
- **organs**: groups of similar tissues
- **organ systems**
- **organism**: an individual, in this case a multicellular one that possesses organ systems → organs → tissues
- **histology**: tissue structure/function (derived from *hist/o-*, tissue or web)
types of animal tissues: epithelial, connective, muscle, nervous
## epithelial
- from *epi-*, outer; *thelium* (*p.* thelia), nipple/papilla/projection; *-al*, of or pertaining to or adjectival
- tightly-packed, tightly-junctioned tissues which prevent materials from passing
- **basement membrane**: secreted protein and glycoprotein membrane which anchors epithelial tissue to rest of organ
- identify via number of cell layers and shape of cells
	- **number of layers:**
		- **simple epithelial**: singular layer
			- areas of passage (absorption/secretion — lungs and intestine)
		- ***stratified* epithelial**: multiple layers
			- areas of frictional stress and cover (skin, mouth and throat lining)
		- **pseudostratified epithelial**: single layer that appears stratified due to illusion of depth, created by differences in height amongst epithelial cells
	- **shape:**
		- **squamous**: thin and flat; derives from *squame, squama*: covering that is *scale*, plate, or flake-like; fish or reptile-like
		- **cuboidal**: you know… like a cube… cuboid…
		- **columnar**: you know… like a column…
- naming conventions based on number/shape
	- for a stratified tissue: tissue is named by free, unattached surface of epithelial tissue layer
- **epidermis**: outer layer; *epi-* + *-dermis*
- **nephron**: microscopic tubules found in the kidneys, surrounded by blood vessel; used for the processing of urine and the primary component of the kidney
- **lumen**: free space within a cell
- **villi** (*sg.* villus); finger-like projections (derived from a latin word which references a thick tuft of hair, like fleece)
	- may be pseudostratified
	- evolved structures that increase the **surface area** of cellular lining of intestinal lumen → increase productivity of transport proteins and absorption of nutrients through intestinal wall
		- **microvilli**: microscopic *folds* in the cellular plasma membrane with identical function
- **brush border**: the free, unattached surface of the cells surrounding the lumen
- **goblet cells**: vase or goblet-shaped cells that contain light-staining mucous
	- secretion of <u>mucous</u> for lubrication and protection
## connective
- diverse junction and support tissues, including blood cell
- contains a **matrix**: dividers made from extracellular material (secreted within tissues in the **fibroblast** cell) that separate cells in a given tissue
	- **proteinaceous fibers**: collagenous or elastic or etc. fibers; made from a given protein and submerged in a ground substance that keeps them from separating
		- collagen vs. elastin proteins; some have both, some only one
		- string-like
	- **ground substance**: dense liquid or **gelatinous** combination of *glycoproteins and polysaccharides*
- named by density and fiber or protein
- **macrophages**: large, grain-textured *phago*cytic cells made from *wbcs*
- **adipocytes**: adipose tissue cells; tight packing with transparent/colorless **triglycerides**
	- “chicken wire” appearance
	- within fat vacuoles in adipose tissue
- **chondrocytes**: cartilage tissue cells (ex. hyaline cartilage)
	- organ is packed with **chondrin** ground substance and collagenous fibers
		- glass/fog appearance of chondrin matrix
	- semi-solid matrix with **lacunae** holes for cells
	- no blood vessels in cartilage; slow diffusion through ground substance
	- side: hyaline cartilage is paired with adipose tissue
- **osteocytes**: bone tissue cells with a spiderlike appearance created by thin cytoplasmic projections
	- within the lacunae of the solid crystalline matrix in bone
	- **Haversian system** is all **osteons**: groupings of **lamellae** layers (ring structure) and a central **Haversian canal**
		- smaller canals: **canaliculi** →  “solid, crack-like” appearance
- **blood cells** are divided into two types
	- rbc: erythrocyte
	- wbc: leukocyte
- **blood cell matrix: plasma**; serum ground substance, albumin proteins → blood viscosity and others → blood clots
- **mammalian erythrocytes are anucleated;** concave hemoglobin disks that lack nuclei
	- non-mammalian are nucleated
- five types of leukocytes; all are colorless

## muscle
- skeletal, cardiac, smooth muscle (digestive, blood, tract, involuntary movement muscles)
- all muscle tissues can contract, perform mechanical work
- distinguished muscle tissues
- **skeletal**: long, **multinucleic**, ribbed pattern (**striation**) caused by arrangement of protein fibers used in contraction; **cylindric**; nuclei are on edges of tissue
	- voluntary contractions
- **cardiac**: striated, **uninucleic, short, y-shape** cells; posses **intercalcated disks** → dark, thick junctions that connect cardiac cells
	- only animal hearts
	- involuntary
- **smooth**: **no striation → name**; thin, spindle-shape/tapering, uninucleic cells;
	- may be confused with dense fibrous connective tissue; nuclei are **ovaline** in smooth muscles and compressed in dfct
## nervous
- brain; **electrical signaling** → responses to stimuli and communications; **action potential** generates responses
- large physiology unit
- **neuron**: basic cell of nervous system; → dendrons; cell body with parts attached that rip off when spliced for slidework
- large, star-shape **cell body** composed of motor neurons: possesses a single nucleus and nucleolus
	- **neurofibrils**; small, dark in stains
- **axon** v. **dendrite**: axon is long-distance, transmits to other tissue cells; dendrite is short, transmits between neurons; thin axons are easy to tear
- **glial cell** (**Schwann cells** are linear) → **grow around axons**, increase speed of transmission,
# 20240124 | phylogenetics
- **outgroup**: *distantly* related taxa ie wolves and lions
	- family, genus
- pinnae: ear flaps vs merged earholes (“ear pinning”)
- **summary code**: symbolic representation of variation in characters
	- ie 0: ancestral state for character (assigned to outgroup)
	- 1+: evolutionary novelty
- **distance matrix**: calculate number of differences between taxa and use to calculate sister groups and distance on trees in values of number of differences
	- used for larger phylogenies
- **convergent evolution**: common evolution in distinct separate species / systems due to similar environmental pressures
	- tasmanian wolf vs timber wolf
- **cytochrome c**: cellular respiration
# 20240204
- hypothesis: proposal that might be true -> experiments
	- null hypothesis: predicts no difference or change between observed and expected (ratio), no difference across populations; no actual change
		- there is no difference between the expected genotype ratio of 25AA:50Aa:25aa and the observed ratio.
	- straightforward, understand what is being tested. boring tm
- statistics determine meaningfulness or chance of experiment results; likelihood of repetition for outcome
- chi square: ratio format data; observed to expected
- compare o v e genotype, allele, phenotypic frequencies
- genotype frq: 2 deg freedom (3 classes in hwe)
